35,v6EjmbMgv80,"Don't get me wrong, the XM5 noise cancelling is superior when the AI isn't confused. I'm a little late to the party with this one. I once was a BOSE person. Then I discovered the XM3s after seeing reviews. And then I went to Fry's and tried them. Compared to the BOSE that were out at the time the XM3s were out, I was sold. Fast forward and I'm still rocking the XM3s. I decide to take a leap of faith and skip over the XM4s straight to the 5s. My first impressions of the new design did not excite me. I prefer the XM3 and 4 design simply because they are similar to the BOSE design of the past. The 5s do not clamp down on my ears. I have smaller ears also and the bigger hole for the ear pads swallow my ears making the ear cups so loose on my head that the head phones fall off. Also, if a person wears glasses, the ear pads do not create a good enough seal to keep the noise cancelling quiet and out side noises out. The overall design does not work for glasses, small heads, and small ears. The headband should be thicker with more padding. I like the concept of the overall design and understanding that Sony was competing with BOSE but I think the wearable design could be so much better. 

The headphones are so lightweight that I did not feel they justified a $400 dollar price tag. The smaller drivers, the vegan leather on the ear pads are horrible. They sound more BOSE like than Sony like. The Ear Pads need way more cushion. They are not thick enough. 

For the controls, they are similar to the previous models. I just hate the fact that the noise cancelling adjustment is through AI and not the Optimizer as in the previous models. There were times I was talking with my headphones on (without speak to chat on) and the noise cancelling was so confused thinking I was moving when I was not.  I tried for two days to love these headphones. But I just couldn't. They were way too big for my head and the sound just didn't match my expectations. 

In other words the XM5s are the BOSE of the Suburbs while the XM3s are the best for the Urbanites. 

Hopefully the XM6s will outdo all previous models. Sorry Sony I had to return them to Best Buy. Sticking with the XM3s until they die.",Steph G.

56,dEHYA-jACoU,"I rate Sony's after sales service as nothing short of terrible. When I bought it home, the earphones were already a little bit flawed. I didn‚Äôt pay much attention to it at first. I bought it for two months, and the rotating part fell off. It‚Äôs not my intentional damage, it‚Äôs the quality and design of their products question. At the same time, many people have such problems. Their customer service didn't help me, just gave me 80$ off and told me to buy a new one. Sony didn't want to fix my problems, they just wanted to make more money from me. This made me very angry. As far as Sony is concerned, all physical damage is not covered by the warranty, which means that no matter what kind of problem you have with your headphones, they will not help you fix it. It will only let you contact their customer service, and tell you that they can only give you a discount of 80$ and you still have to spend 320 to buy a new one.

64,BdvOuKTi3CE,"Had the xm3 xm4 and now xm5. Wore the xm4 for an average of 6 hours per day for 3 years and now switched to the xm5. I wear them for music and calls and ear protection during work (woodworking). Reason for le to upgrade to the xm5 was, that whenever I answered a call on the xm4, nobody would hear me. To fix the call, I had to quickly disconnect and reconnect bluetooth -so the other end wouldnt know for 5-6 seconds, what was going on. Vey annoying. No problems with the xm5's. Also...calling quality is worlds better (people hear me perfectly, which was not the case with the xm4).The noise cancelling is not as good in the xm5 as it was in the xm4 (circular saw, and other very loud machinery)...xm4 was amazing in cancelling fast changing high pitched and loud noises, whereas the xm5 is doing a considerable worse job. My experience. I wouldnt upgrade acain, but am keeping them because of the phone answering function actually working. So...if you use them for calls...stick with xm5. If you use them for (really loud) noise cancelling - then xm4.",Zorbey Schuster

- Cancelamento de ru√≠do: ambos s√£o bons, mas o XM3 consegue cancelar melhor os ru√≠dos mais agudos (barulho de teclado, pessoas falando... XM3 ganha de longe)
- Conforto: XM5 esquenta mais a orelha, e o suporte de cabe√ßa fino machuca depois de mais de 1h de uso.
- Qualidade do som: fiquei horas mexendo no Equalizador do XM5 pra tentar chegar perto do padr√£o de f√°brica do XM3... Mas os agudos ainda parecem um pouco mais ""estourados"", e o grave, embora bem pr√≥ximo, no XM3 √© mais encorpado.

Who want heavy headphones? Im not paying $450 for a pair of plastic headphones who don‚Äôt even feel good on your head let alone sound good. Nor do they even come close to apples ANC. You don‚Äôt even feel them after a long while. I went out after my APM died and got the XM5s and oh boy was I dissatisfied and disappointed, it feels cheap, dinky and just like a toy compared to APM. The noise cancelling? APM beats any Sony or Bose by miles. Sound? APM, all day. 
Price? With APM on Best Buy being basically $120 less there‚Äôs no competition. Like no competition at all. I had to return XM5s just after 12 hours, worst headphones I‚Äôve head.
The touch controls on XM5s were worthless, volume control on it was absolute abysmal. 
The headband is one of the worst I‚Äôve ever felt. Even Beats Solo from 2013 beats them. The Transparency mode? lol not even gonna say anything because it‚Äôs embarrassing for a pair of $450 headphones. 
The ANC on Sonys is not good compared to apples. Literally, I can‚Äôt take you seriously if you say otherwise.

132,UZhn-Q5OhJw,"I upgraded from the xm4s to the xm5s. Neither would qualify as an audiophile headphone and you wouldn't expect them to be but the xm5s are more refined sounding, balanced and closer to that target (I've owned many audiophile headphones and have a good reference). The xm4s have too much bass bloat and lack speed and resolution. The xm5s have very muted upper treble and can sound ""dead"" but the built-in eq can fix that. Other than that they're very pleasant sounding if you're not doing any critical listening and just want to enjoy music in the background. They also have virtually no background hiss, which the xm4s do have so they're effectively quieter. Certain frequencies the xm5s cancel out better too.",Cas Perry

138,UZhn-Q5OhJw,portability/case & lack of folding is annoying but i dont travel w/ headphones as im worried theyll fall off. i dont want a pair of $400 headphones to fall & get damaged (which is why i travel w/ airpods instead) so the case & inability to fold arent deal breakers for me. what i do however is sit at my desk for hours on end & i have not once in the 6mo ive had the xm5s complained about my head/ears hurting or any discomfort. i do wish they fit a bit more snug so they wouldnt slide off so easily but i have a tiny head & only sit (not move much) w/ them on lol other than that they have been very good to me,eryn

165,9a-3r2llDjI,Why do people complain about foldabillity?  How are you using your headphones??  I keep mine on the head or on my nightstand. If im traveling i vill deff have them on my head and not in any backpack.  Its like complaining about your car not folding so you can fit it in your closet.  Thats not how you use the car.  Ive never seen anyone ever use the case for any headphones,kalle anka
166,9a-3r2llDjI,"I agree with most of what you have said. The only two things I disagree with are the ANC and the sound signature.  

I don't think the ANC is that great on these or even the Bose. I really don't understand what everyone is raving on about. Imo, out of the bunch Bose QC45 blocks out the ambience sounds though still not great. 

When your playing music and blasting audio into you head you can't hear anything anyway. I guess it depends on at what point do you measure the noice cancellation?
 For me it's when there is no music playing is the true measure on how well these do with noise. Anyway rant over  ANC for now lol.

 The sounds quality is good but not as great as you've  mentioned here, this is a subjective point though.  The base is great as always, it's Sony's selling point but it somehow distorts the vocals. Even when you try messing about with the EQ the treble feels like you're on an airplane and you get that airy hissing noise. 
 The clarity isn't spot on like the Bose. If the Bose managed to allow the EQ to be base punchy as the Sony that would the ideal selling headphone imo.

 Also one positive thing to point out the is no sounds leakage with the new Sony Mx5's which is plus point. 

Keep up the good reviews - I just found your channel recently.",Zubair Hasan

224,nRjOrpywEZk,"Just a heads up for the people that watch this before purchase. Multipoint is well and truly broken on these headphones when connecting to a phone and PC simultaneously. When connecting to both and playing audio from the windows PC, the headphones glich, loudly play a single note for five seconds, and crash/turn off. This happens every few minutes making the headphones completely useless. Both the headphones and PC have up to date firmware and it still happens despite my changing the bluetooth adaptor in my PC. 

 DO NOT BUY THESE  IF YOU INTEND TO USE MULTIPOINT WITH A WINDOWS PC. This issue popped up on my first set and also on the second set I recently receivied (that I received under warranty). I now plan to return these for a different (non-Sony) model entirely. Sony customer support is literally non-existent, initially ignoring my contact requests and then responding to simply tell me that I should initialise the headphones (despite stating in the complaint that I had initialised both pairs multiple times). The only communication from Sony is to do something that provably DOES NOT WORK.

275,6WTHBCZBt_E,"I appreciate the fact that every song that was played was kept at the same level so I was not startled by you switching different headsets. The depth of knowledge you have about audio engineering is insane. Mad respect. I've worked in theatrical lighting for years, but could never find myself working with sound. Overall love the detail, editing, and knowledge you've placed into this video. I ended up buying the Apple AirPods Max specifically for comfort and the fact that I own other Apple products which makes them more compatible, but I do think Sony XM5 really does outweigh for quality, battery life, and comfort (if I were to partake in endurance based activities). One year later this video is still very helpful!!",Tia Fields

The APM are just out of warranty and Apple support couldn't fix it so sending it in and paying their fee was my only option. I like the weight of the XM5's and sound is great. I just can't get past the lack of quality of the XM5 when compared to the APM. They are flimsy. Also really like the volume knob being on the headphone on the APM as well as its extra functionality. The haptics of the APM buttons makes me enjoy using them. Sound and noise canceling is similar. Last, the APM has a sensing switch so when you put them on your ear they turn on so you don't have to keep pushing the tiny cheap XM5 button...so the 20 vs 30 hour gap might be lessoned. Bottom line is I'm sending back the XM5's.",J D

So people are talking and they don't know I can't hear them. I have to drop out of the call and come back to get my audio back.

421,-7EustHpOBc,I'm looking for either anc earbuds or headphones. I have misofonia so my number 1 factor is noice cancellation. Im very interested in the sony xm5 earbuds as I lost one of my xm3 earbuds yesterday :( But thanks to that I'm kind of free again and able to experience a different brand. It seems like sony so far has the best noise cancelling so far which is sad because I wish that other brands would be on that level. Also I know the sony app and it works well. I agree its a bit clunky however once I'm setup I almost never use the app.,GUNFUN 777

430,-7EustHpOBc,"Great review. I have been using both since the PX7 S2 was released. (I bought the Sony two weeks earlier not knowing the PX7 s2 was about to release. Anyway.)

I agree 99% with the review. Sound quality-wise as one could expect the PX7 s2 is obviously better, but for noise-cancelling and other user experience features the Sony is better, in terms of comfort, software, weight, etc. 

But just one feature I beg to differ. I prefer the hardware buttons on the PX7 s2 over the touch control on the Sony for one reason: volume control. It‚Äôs too cumbersome +/- volume by several levels as you need to swipe the ear cup a lot of times. I need that when I, say, enter a library from the street. If Sony adopts the circular motion like the B&O counterparts that would be perfect. 

I like the PX7 s2 more but frankly I use the Sony much more. I guess that‚Äôs exactly what Sony wants it to be from a market point of view.",Colin Lai

549,vcO43qPu9e4,"Where I live, the XM5 are half the price of Airpods Max, but no matter how much I tried to like them, they just feel way too cheap even for that price.

550,vcO43qPu9e4,"My Take ForYour Consideration .  .   .
The XM5 just look so cheap and are upon examination very cheaply built . 
Sony abandoned the unrivaled fit of the XM3 XM4 Which is better than any headphones in my collection .
 I feel like a peasant wearing the XM5s And Sony Felt It A Good Thing To Up The Price By $50.00 .
 I Bought & Returned 2 Pairs Of XM5s Months Apart Trying To Give XM5 A Second Chance To See The Value In Them And Other Than The ANC Their Is No Value I Could Find In The XM5s . 
The Headband Is Ultra Thin And Hurts the Top Of my Head Which Has Never Happened With My XM3 Or XM4 .
My SoundCore Q35 & Q45 Have Better Sound Quality And Look Much Nicer Than Sony XM5 Especially The Q45 .

552,vcO43qPu9e4,"DON'T BUY SONY BUDS!  My WF-1000XM4 have NEVER given more than an hour of listening.  I typically accept any glitches that occur are on my end.   But also expect professional, helpful support for WELL RATED, BUT EXPENSIVE product.   I own working products - Walkman, an old point n shoot, two Vaios.  BUT THESE BUDS AND SUPPORT HAVE BEEN HORRIFIC. I'm not a technophile, I always blame my unfamiliarity, not the product.  BUT after a half dozen calls over a year, I threw in the towel. ¬†Over months I spoke with lovely off-shore customer service. But, when I finally threw in the towel, and asked to send for check-up OR get a U.S. Rep to call me, ROADBLOCKS.

First, SONY won't send anything to our business U.S.P.S. Box!  We're in a rural community and boxes typically get damaged or picked.  Yet, a) SONY will not allow communication with U.S. reps - only Central Amer or Phillipines.  Lovely folk, but claim unable to enable U.S. contacts.  HOURS wasted.

616,PBIbsvZSp24,I would‚Äôve stuck with the xm4 if the Bluetooth capability was stronger. I would connect them to my phone and play music and it took up to 15 seconds to pair. My phone would start playing music out of its speakers and this happened every time I used the xm4. The xm5 has an almost instant pairing and the phone speakers never play out music.,KID SWAY
617,PBIbsvZSp24,"You nailed the explanation of the sound quality compared to the XM4s. I listen to a lot of hip hop and reggaeton, music with a lot of beats, and the 5's cannot match the 4s and 3s in that segment. I have to play around with the equalisers a lot to get near to that level. However, mids and highs sound clearer.

644,OnnHTKrTeAA,"Sony clearly hates to pay codec licensing fees to anyone else, and thinks they're the 800 lb gorilla in every media space.  As a result, they LOVE to develop their own proprietary codecs for everything.  Remember MiniDiscs?",Jared Hunter
645,OnnHTKrTeAA,"I really don't understand why none of these models support an optional boom mic accessory.  Mic performance *really* matters for work calls, and the way to get decent voice quality is to put the mic closer to the mouth, period.  It's not like these models have water resistance that makes them reasonable for consistent outdoor use, so why not lean into the work use case that justifies the price point?",Jared Hunter

647,OnnHTKrTeAA,"Ok sooooooo one major thing wrong with this video, the airpodmax more then likely sound better because apple devices dont support high quality bluetooth audio codecs... and the airpod max and apple products do extra tweaking to get the most out of a much weaker bluetooth signal, most android primium phones support ldac which is much better then aac which is below cd quality that the iphone is only capable of pumping out, so to get to the point youre using the well adjusted airpods max with apple devices and that means that the sony xm5 is getting much less information than its capable of producing, not knocking you but this is very misleading, if you have apple products get airpods anything because its software and hardware are adjusted for lower frequencies, if you have a high end android device the sony xm5 would be the better choice, my suggestion is watch a video on how bt audio codecs work",Pop Lock

I can now get the MX4s for ¬£199 as opposed to the MX5s which are ¬£120 more!!  (both on Amazon UK) .  In your opinion are the MX5s actually worth paying an extra ¬£120   ( ie 60% more!) ????

682,uGSQ1PtSmPY,"Thanks for watching this video!

On a side note, I have addressed this 10 days ago, and multiple times to individuals since, and I say again - For anyone wondering if my WF-1000XM5 reviews were tested on a pre-production unit, it was not. Reviews were done based on a retail unit with the latest firmware 2.0.1 installed. As a non-priority reviewer I got the unit the day after the launch, the same day the firmware came out. And that same day, I updated the unit, tested it, filmed and published a video.

Moving forward, I will not respond to any questions about whether this is a pre-production unit as this topic has been addressed ad nauseum. Thank you!",Aaron X Loud and Wireless

694,uGSQ1PtSmPY,"Thanks for doing such detailed comparisons. I had a couple of questions:

1. I see a lot of people on the Sony subreddit saying that if you go into the headphones app and turn off adaptive sound control, then drag the slider under ambient sound control all the way to the right, and then slowly drag all the way to the left it will fix the rapid changing of anc levels. Can you test this and see if you notice an improvement?

2. You mentioned sidetone can't be turned off on the wh-1000xm5, but I've seen some people say you can turn it off and others say the headphones only play ambient sound when you're talking. Can you test if anc stays on during a call when you're not talking? My biggest complaint with my xm4 is the pass through picking up every little sound while I'm on a call even when I'm not talking. In a noisy airport or office it's almost impossible to hear what the person I'm talking to is saying because of background noise / keyboard keys and mice clicking, etc.

Thanks in advance!",beeroge1020

felt heavier than the xm5 but more comfortable head padding 

Xm5:
Better sound quality imo 
Stellar ambient mode 
Thinner ear pads or maybe they just are much softer  which does make your ears touch depending on your facial structure 
The anc is better but it does tend to switch sometimes which might bother some it didn‚Äôt for me but yes i do touch the button somtimes 
Overall: i went for the xm5 because the wind sound is quiet and the ambient mode is so much better. 

Go for what your ears like i highly suggest you get both and return one üòÇ‚ù§",SSBzhum

827,5AUFQl9n6hw,"Thank you for this review. I purchased the Samsung Galaxy Pro2 Earbuds several months ago after purchasing my 2022 Samsung 55 inch OLED SB95 4K television. I didn't like the way the earbuds felt and they sometimes fell out my ears from walking around inside my apartment while watching television. I decided to purchase the Sony WH-1000XM4 Black Friday on sale for $228.00 at Best Buy. I love the Sony XM4 headphones and the sound quality watching television and battery life is fantastic. They are now back to the original price of $349.00 at Best Buy. I realize, there is the Sony WH-1000XM5 for $399.99 on sale at Best Buy for $349.99. I saved $110 on the Sony WH-1000XM4 and this is a good deal.  The M4 is just as good as the M5 and I am satisfied with the M4's.",Daddy Grace

Also, their customer service will NOT reimburse or replace them for you, no matter what.",LapinBeau
883,VGaV_YJhWqo,Went from a bunch of Beats Studios 2.0 and 3.0 to my current xm4s. Not happy with the smaller driver on the xm5 since I seen too many reviews mentioning the bass lacking even more compared to the xm4 and big time compared to the xm3. Momentum 4s look tempting but so do the AirPods Max,Zay Will
884,VGaV_YJhWqo,"Off topic, Does anc works without hearing music? Is it possible to cancel the noise from outside and be complete and solely silent?",Gianni
885,VGaV_YJhWqo,"Many tests say that the XM4's noise cancelling is much better in the low frequencies, is this true or not?

Also, how much of a problem is it that the M4 anc cannot be switched off? This is not mentioned",Morgi
886,VGaV_YJhWqo,Xm5 is the best for everyday users. I was on the highway in the back with the window  open on a windy day and my sister thought I was talking to her in a my condo. The microphones are levels above the momentum 4 and xm4. I noticed with the momentum 4s that you literally have to take the headphones off to use your phone to talk because the sound quality is horrendous and the same goes for the xm4. If your looking for better sound and slightly less bass with better noise cancellation and 8 mic‚Äôs go for the Xm5‚Äôs they are literally perfect,Just watch that 
887,VGaV_YJhWqo,The momentum 4 are 217 euro here. I wanted to get the Xm4 but the price got my attention for the Momentus so which one should I get,Ubeyd

889,VGaV_YJhWqo,"Thanks for the comprehensive review! I owned XM5 for a while, so while I'm pretty satisfied with it, I feel that the sound quality could be much better for the price tag. I'm eyeing future Senny headphone in the future for the better sound quality in general",Michael Muliadi
890,VGaV_YJhWqo,Does anybody know if any of those software issues have been fixed on Sennheiser M4's?,Ignas Januskevicius
891,VGaV_YJhWqo,"Interesting review. Just goes to show how individual a preference of a housesound is.
I cannot get along with the Momentum 4, but the XM4 suits me well. In general, the Sennheiser housesound has never been for me, being it HD600's, HD650's, or HD800s'.But Beyer, Sony, Ultrasone, Shure, AT and others work well. Not sure how Sennheiser does it, but their sound is simply sit too far in the drivers - same issue with AKG. Out of all my collection, my XM4's are definitely my go-to over-ear wireless, especially because wireless is just not where you go for high end audiophile sound - so the sound needs to be fun, lively and easy to listen to.",AB-80X
892,VGaV_YJhWqo,"Personally, the biggest issue I've had with Sony XM4's is the build quality. 1 year after purchase, the ANC on right-side failed, repaired under warranty. 2 years after purchase, the right-side ANC failed again but I was able to somehow fix it by opening the earcup and fiddling with the feedback mic. 2.5 years after purchase, ANC on left-side failed and cannot seem to fix it. So, that's 2.5 years of use from 350‚Ç¨ headphones....",Samu
893,VGaV_YJhWqo,"Sound is so subjective; saying they sound better than the Sony WH M4 and M fives is just a personal opinion. I have seen audio engineers put Sony's headphones at the top of their list when it comes to flagship headphones. It also will vary with regard to sound because everybody has different devices. For example, most Android devices have LDAC support & I bet the M fives sound just as good as the Sennheiser headphones with that device. On the other hand, I bet the headphones sound much more flat with an Apple device.",nick albano
894,VGaV_YJhWqo,"Ok so I had both the xm5 and the momentum 4. I gotta say this: Sony will spoil you with the noise cancelation and those app features. However - and this is important - the momentum 4 is the winer here because the noise cancelation is just a touch weaker than the Sony's. That means that you will not hear any noise once your music is on. You will only hear some high pitch sounds when you're not playing music. And the cabin pressure thing is not there either. The sound quality in the momentums is on a pro level when compared to Sony's, cause the Sony's sound is... just playing music... and the momentums sound much like the instruments of the song were right there in front of you. You will notice that when you play live concerts or classical music.But also in the details eg in some progressive tracks. Trust me their sound is BIG and Sony's sound like a regular set of headphones compared to momentum's. And they are more comfy too, cause in my example Sony's earpads just touched my ears on the edges and it felt  a lil bit like you were having that rubber cap on your head when you go swimming. The Sony's are objectively better in noise cancelling but when you try the momentums you will forget the Sony's. I tried these in a really old and loud, shaking train and the noise around me wasn't like completely gone but the ANC was good enough to make me not notice it at all. Sony's ARE better, but you don't need it. Plus the sound... Oh and regarding the issues. I haven't noticed any of those mentioned in the video. The reviewer here is probably using one of the first peaces. Right after launching the app there was an update with some fixes and they even included the 5 band EQ.",Vladim√≠r Petija
