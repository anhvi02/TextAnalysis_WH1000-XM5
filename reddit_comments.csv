4,"Recently I bought the Sony XM5 Headphones and I noticed that the Noice Cancellation in them is horrible.
Having Noise Cancellation option activated or not is almost the same thing. Even my AirPods Pro do a better job.
The fact that with Noise Cancellation on I can still hear people walking, talking, smartphones and every, literally EVERY SOUND.
I don't know if I should return and get a new pair. But please tell me if this happened to you and what did you do to solve it. 
Strange that in all the videos I see of the noise cancellation test in these headphones when the option is enabled it is almost silent, and in my headphones I can hear absolutely everything."

6,"AirPods Pro nc is very good. I pretty much thought they are at least on par, or AirPods Pro better until one day there was drilling at home. Sony was a lot better. Bottom line is depending on your use case one of them may be better. I find AirPods Pro having issues dealing with rain pattering sounds. It all depends on which sound frequency it’s cancelling."

8,"I had my headphones for a little while now. I love these things. When I plugged them in once the battery died, the charging light would go on. I had them plugged in for hours, and the percentage is always stuck at 1 percent. I thought it was just a battery glitch, but even after using them, they still end up turning off saying ""battery is empty"". I tried multiple chargers and the battery wouldn't go up at all, even though the charging light turns on, indicating it's charging. What can I do? Did anyone have this problem before? I reset them etc. Not sure what else to do."

17,"I have since about two years back owned a pair of WF-1000XM4's and have been very pleased with them.
I really like the audio quality and noice canceling of them. But recently the right earbud have had a significant battery problem where it now only lasts about 15-25 minutes. It is to my understanding that some kind of update has been released for them which caused them to overheat and then frying the battery (i don't know exactly what has happened just that i am not the only one with similar issues). 
Since this is my first pair of Sony headphones/earbuds i wonder if this is a common problem across all of sony's products and if so, it is worth taking the risk of buying another pair (the WF-1000XM5)?
It is quite a lot of money for me to spend on a pair of earbuds but if the problem (most likely) will not appear again, i think that it can be worth the large sum. 
Thanks in advance."

19,"It's not a general Sony thing as far as I can tell, the XM4s seem to have it quite regularly though. Mine still work fine and I got them shortly after release.
I received my XM5s in the mail this friday. I get serious discounts on multimedia products, just before you start wondering about my spending habits.
Overall I really liked my XM4s, sound, ANC and battery life are really great. I always had problems with the fit and their size though, which was my main reason to upgrade. I did consider many other buds (Linkbuds, Jabra, Samsung...) but since I liked the sound of the XM4s a lot I just stuck with this series. The XM5s sound a tiny bit different but overall have a similar signature imo. I ran my XM4s with a slight reduction on bass and tiny emphasis on treble and the XM5s sound close to this setup right out of the box. The fit is much better for me, and the case is smaller as well.
There's a couple of small things that annoy me with the XM5s: you can't switch ANC/Ambient off on the buds themselves. On the XM4s there was a setting to cycle between the 3 modes, now you can only switch between ANC and ambient. Generally, if you control the ANC with the buds, double and triple taps on that bud go unused and aren't freely configurable. Same as on the XM4s but still annoying.
The other thing is that they're glossy. Super minor gripe, but I much prefer the matte finish of the XM4s.
If you're overall happy with the XM4s I'd definitely get them fixed instead of upgrading though. The XM5s are a bit better in many aspects but only marginally so. You might be just out of warranty but I'd still contact Sony about fixing them. Earbuds shouldn't be basically unusable after 2.5 years. Here's a link to a megathread in the SonyHeadphones subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyHeadphones/comments/x7mx2n/wf1000xm4_severe_battery_issues/"
20,Thank you so much!

22,"My PC is connected to my TV and all is well, HDR is working and there is no noticeable drop in FPS. However when I launch a game (Genshin Impact) the HDMI signal drops out every few seconds, but when it is working there is no drop in FPS still. All games run at a smooth 60 FPS, they just cut out every few seconds. This problem does not occur when I launch other games like Destiny 2. I would really appreciate if anyone can help, this never happened when I used anything else as a monitor and it’s weird that it’s just the one game that causes this."

28,"I connected my headset to 2 devices :

Device 1 is an Android phone
Device 2 is a laptop

It works fine, and switches seamlessly from one device to another when it detects sound input.
Only problem I have : if it's connected to the laptop and the phone rings, I can not answer it by double-tapping on the right. The call is detected, the laptop's output is muted, and I can hear the ringing in the headset. But nothing happens when I double tap the right earphone. I have to answer the call on the phone itself (and then everything works as expected, I can talk through the headset).
When only the phone is connected (no multipoint), answering a call by double-tapping works fine.
Any idea ?"

I’ve never taken a camera abroad with me before (besides my phone), so I’m not sure if I’ll need to bring a voltage converter to avoid damaging the camera?

38,"Really excited about this set-up and loving my headphones so far. Only issue is that audio only plays out of the left-side of my headphones when I have the jack plugged into my PC. 
Weirdly enough, if I slightly disconnect the VMODA from it's split-connector that goes into my pc, the audio will come through on both ears but I lose input. 
​
How can I fix this set-up?"

40,"Sounds like it's your pc causing the issue, are you splitting the connection or ?"
41,"How could it be my pc? Yes I'm splitting the connecting with the audio output/input splitter than came with the mic, and plugging that into my pc"
42,"ah well if you're splitting it it's probably either the splitter itself (which I doubt cause they included it themselves) or the input on your pc which I do suspect it being.
There are these things, TRS/TRRS/TRRRS and they're basically the rings on the jack plug and TRS is like stereo but without anything else and TRRS is stereo + your mic input and what I'm guessing is that you are plugging TRRS into a TRS pc input"
43,"Interesting, thanks for the info.
I’m not sure that’s it, however. The splitter is a TRRS into two TRS that are plugged into my pc as shown. What’s weird is that if my splitter is a notch unplugged from the mic cable, audio works in both ears.
Maybe it’s an issue with my Drivers? Idk

67,"I've had the xm5's for a week now, and don't get me wrong. They are great headphones. But I'm honestly disappointed in the noice cancelling. I feel like they should block out more noice then what they do. Like for instance, voices are really piercing through them I feel. 
Anyone else who agrees? And if you've had both the xm4 and the xm5's how is the difference? Or just thoughts in general?"

69,"I’m not sure if these headphones were ever meant to make you deaf from the outside world, it just drowns out the noise around you. And at the end of the day, some sounds will always be louder than your headphones. 
However, if you’re in a quieter space and can still hear everything, that’s concerning. Once I’m inside the house, I can’t hear anything else at all."
70,"Compared to what other Anc?
None do high freq well, IEM block more before the Anc."
71,"Did you turn on ANC?  
Mine seem to default to Ambient Sound when I power them on."
72,"I don't agree with you because i satisfied very much with anc because it blocks most of voices and i was at 15 hours flight, it blocked plane noises very well. Maybe you turned on adaptive anc so it doesn't block all voices because you need to hear other voices like car noises a little bit but if you want full anc so turn off adaptive one."
73,"I bought a used (yes, genuine!) pair of XM3s some time ago and, despite the fact that I absolutely LOVE them and couldn't live without them, I was rather disappointed with ANC performance. It just didn't match up to the dramatic descriptions everyone else had of the world quietly fading away. Even super predictable stuff like fans or engines it only toned them down a bit, like really good passive blocking. I am beginning to suspect the ear pads."

79,"Hello guys,
I've a Sony PRS-350 ereader that works wonderfully and I love it. Some weeks ago it the battery couldn't hold the charging and so I search the Internet for instructions to replace it with a new one. I found it was a very easy procedure so I went to buy a new battery for it. I bought it in a specialized battery shop and replaced it very easily. But now, when I try to charge the PRS-350 i get a message on screen that the charging is stopped due to overheating, and the ereader is not hot. Have you had the same experience? Do you know what can it be? The new battery still had some charge, so when I unplug the ereader from charging, it works perfectly, so I think it's not a problem with new battery.
I saw in YouTube a video for a workaround with this issue in a Sony T2 ereader, something like bypassing a overheating chip in the board that prevented the original battery from charging. 
Any ideias or experiences about this issue? I'd really love to fix this, because my PRS-350 is perfectly fine and I love it so much! 
Thanks for your attention

Now every evening when we watch TV for the first time that day.  After we are done watching a show we turn off the TV.  Then we are sitting around chatting and about 5-10 min later the amplifier will turn on as if it received a signal over HDMI from the TV.  The TV itself is not turning on.  Then shortly later maybe 1 min or so the Amplifier turns off.   
If I turn the TV on again and off again it will NOT happen again.  It just appears to be the first time we use the TV that day.    
I have no logical explanation and have made sure no scheduled events or anything are setup in the TV or Google OS.  Again the TV itself is not powering on but the  Amplifier is. This is a 7+ year old amplifier and it is connected the same way it was to the other TV on e/ARC."

110,"i bought the prs-350 recently and was shocked to find the above named isn't available for UK users- either on the Sony site or... anywhere.  I cant deep-dive as... their is nothing to search.  Seems like no one is discussing this and im surprised considering how recent it was actioned: https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/support/reader-digital-book-prs-series/prs-650/articles/00288164
Does anyone know of alternative software, another way of downloading books to the device or another model perhaps that functions for UK users and doesn't stray from the traditional aluminium-case aesthetic.  Web navigation is confusing and signposting non-existent (i think they still have the original web page for the reader download, but the link to initiate times out- amateur hour or what Sony smh) 
Im guessing there must be otherwise why would retailers (Cex, Amazon) still be selling these?
an e-Reader noob here so any advice is much appreciated."

113,"My ZV 1f is used as my webcam for streaming. My streams often go up to 12 hours.
I purchased in April, still using stock battery.
I plug into the USB-C port to my laptop and the battery seems to stay charging throughout the stream (I literally am plugging its charger from a block into the wall to my laptop so makes sense).
But after about 9 hours it will blink red and shortly after say “battery exhausted” and die on me, ending my stream. This problem has been consistent for recent months and always seems to fail at about 8-9 hours.
Is there some way to overcome this? New battery or different settings? 
Dummy battery?

133,"Has anyone had this before. If the case and buds get completely drained I struggle to get them to charge. 
This usually happens when the case doesn't detect the bud gave been placed in the case and doesn't disconnect the Bluetooth. This runs down the buds and the case. 
The case light does not come on at all when charging with a wire or wireless.
I have tried several chargers and wires and nothing. Plugging the case into my computer, the compurt makes the USB device connected sound and it detects it as a HID device. Using wireless charging, the charger detects the device and using power sharing from my phone, that to indicated the wireless charging is connected but still nothing. 
This had happened once or twice before and the case will randomly start charging upon plugging it in and will be fine for months. 
Or is the case broken some how?

136,"I recently came into ownership of a very gently used Sony camcorder. I’m unfortunately not familiar with camcorders and while I have a digital version of the manual that came with the camcorder I can’t find the answer to my question. 
I have a ProDuo 16gb memory stick in it currently but neither my laptop nor my pc has a way for me to use the memory stick on its own. I know that I can use the mini-usb input to transfer data but I wanted to know if that would also work to transfer the info from the memory stick while it’s still in the camcorder? Or if I would need to get something separate to read the memory stick with.
I appreciate any help 🙏"

155,"Good morning,
I have an old Handycam DCR-TRV19E camcorder on which I recorded 1 hour of video on a mini-DV cassette.
My problem is that I can't transfer the media from the mini-DV tape to my computer, through the camcorder.
I feel like I've tried everything, that's why I'm coming to you, hoping someone can help me.
I will detail everything I've tried :
​
- I tried to simply connect the camcorder using the Sony usb port by activating the USB transfer option in the camcorder menu. My computer recognizes an unknown device but cannot identify it.
CELLONIC® Câble USB 2.0 Transfert données pour Appareil Sony DSC-H300 DSC-H400 DSC-W800 DSC-W810 DSC-W830, DSLR-A900 Cable Charge et Data 1.5m PVC Noir, Cordon caméra : Amazon.fr: Informatique 
​
- Then, i went to the technical documentation of the camera and this time I tried to connect the camcorder to my computer using the A/V output jack port into RCA to USB cables, Still the same problem .

POFET Câble USB vers 3RCA mâle 0,3 m vers 3 RCA Femelles Jack Splitter Audio Vidéo AV Composite Adaptateur pour TV/PC : Amazon.fr: High-Tech 
​
- After further research, I ordered an USB cable with video converter and associated software. Still the same unknown device problem.

​
- I have gone to dark websites to download old drivers or old software supposed to allow me to read the contents of the camcorder, didn't worked.
​
- And today I finally ordered a Firewire IEEE 1394 cable, the last port that I had not yet used on the camcorder, it still marks me as unknown device in my device manager but this time it appears although in the USB bus controller devices, the previous attempts were not even placed in this category and the message ""device descriptor request failed"" appears next to the unknown device.
CY Câble de Cordon d’Adaptateur USB mâle vers FireWire IEEE 1394. 4 Broches mâles iLink pour Sony DCR-TRV75E DV. : Amazon.fr: Informatique 
​
Note that I tried the software supplied with my video acquisition cable, another dark software whose name I have forgotten, OBS Studio but also PlayMemories Home but none of these software is able of recognizing my camcorder .
I also made these attempts on 2 different computers.
If anyone has an idea I'm interested, I admit I have no more ideas..
Sorry for my english.
​
Thanks."

158,"Bought the TV last Dec for $3300 thinking this will last me a long time - but now its just dead? I tried unplugging the cord and waited a few mins, plugged it in and still nothing? Tried to turn it on on the TV itself but still nothing. It was connected to a PC, PC was connected to internet through ethernet - if that has anything to do with it?
How does a high end TV like this simply die and for anyone who’s been in a similar position - what am I looking at? Will Sony send me a different TV or will I have to send it for repair?
This is all covered under warranty and I don’t have to pay for anything?"

161,"Got lucky and somehow found a page on Sony’s website where it told me to unplug the tv, hold power button on tv and at the same time plug it in the outlet and keep holding the power button until a white light shows up on the tv. The tv then turned on and off twice and after a few mins I was able to turn it on. It was a complete factory hard reset. So what I’m thinking happened (maybe?) is that when the tv was turned off last night it tried to do an update but my internet has been acting up lately - so maybe it lost internet while it was doing an update and that messed it up? Just guessing but thank god this fixed everything, I almost gave up"
162,Well at least you managed to fix it. It’s wild anyway

I tried the Canon M50 Mark 2 and the latency was very high at 4k and acceptable but not great at 1080p so I'm looking to upgrade it
My budget is around ~$1000 so if you have any other recommendations that would be greatly appreciated as well
Thank you so much"

I've uploaded some music from my PC onto an SD card in order to play music on my Xperia. The way to add songs to a playlist via the music player app is to add songs one by one to the playlist.

188,"The headphones produce a buzzing noise when noise cancelling is turned on but theres not much going on around. This happens regardless of the headphones connection status and sounds a bit like a mixture of that noise you got with old speakers when you get a phone call back in the days and a modem. It's really irritating. Resetting the headphones did not help.
The quieter it is the more noticeable it gets, it's almost like the headphones get bored of not having to cancel as much noise so they make their own. This is a 350€ product, i do not need weird toys like ear shape scans, I need a product that doesnt start humming as soon as ambient noise levels dip below the level of a moderately busy street. 
I can even suggest a temporary fix to apply until the software is fixed, simply detect low noise levels and automatically turn off noise suppression. Call me lazy, call me whiny, but when spending this kind of cash on in ear headphones with the promise of ""the best noise cancelling"", I expect exactly that, not some product that starts making more noise.
Seeing how im not the only one with this complaint, I hope to see it fixed soon. 
Unrelated sidenote: even with the stable connection preset, the connection would quite frequently cut out briefly on one side, sometimes even permanently. What good are headphones I can't walk with? I'm getting stronger and stronger buyers remorse each and every day."

198,"All in all I'm very impressed with these headphones, staging is great, sound (at least for what I listen to) is fantastic, but I have a couple gripes with these headphones, and wanted to check and see if they were normal, or problems I should send them back for.
When I tried running in them I heard loud booming every time my foot landed, it happens in my car as well when I hit a pot hole, it vaguely sounds like when a subwoofer clips. 
And the other one is noise cancelling/ambient sound swap randomly. I'd doesn't say anything, and I don't hear the chime, it just swaps.

For problem 2 Check to make sure adaptive sound isn't turned on."
202,"check your using noise cancelling, not ambient sound.
Check to ensure the seal is good - experiment with different ear tips.
No one should be driving using noise cancelling headphones, it's dangerous.
I run with these headphones and the only time there's been booming has been without the noise cancelling engaged."
203,"The running issue with the thumping sound is common when noise canceling is on. I get it with the wf xm4, as well as with my galaxy buds2 pro.
It's annoying, so I always turn off ANC whenever I go running. Unless you can be sure that the earbud is so snug/fit that it never moves while in your ear, I don't think there's much you can do about it."

213,"Hey all, I need some advice in finding some good earbuds for school and running. I've been using some random 15$ earbuds I got from Macy's for about a year and I'm ready to get a quality product. I've had a few headsets in the past and I really value good sound quality and noise cancelation (I also like to have good bass but nothing obnoxious). One of the most important factors for me is them staying stable in my ears. I mostly listen to podcasts and music. My budget is 250$ at the absolute max. I know the Bose earbuds are on sale right now but I don't know if they'll be good for running. Thanks!
P.S. They don't have to be from Sony, I'm just asking everywhere to see what most people would say."

215,Sony has inexpensive sport buds that are even watertight. They are called WF-SP800N - in my eyes the best fit if you want to do sports and have NC.
216,"I have them, they sound good and stay in well. They also have great battery life. However, the ANC is quite underwhelming, it struggles with wind and it doesn't do too much to cancel out."
217,"The wf1000xm4 seems like a good deal for you. It has good, detailed bass and a warm sound signature. You might wanna try them in a store or something to check if they really fit in your ears or not and test them out with genres you usually listen too."
218,"WF-1000XM4. In high school right now and have been using them for a few years. The 8-12h battery life is great for the length of a school day, and ambient/ANC modes are great for being able to be attentive or to focus. The XM5s are the newest model but the improvements are really minor and not worth the price. The only issue could be the the 4s are big for earbuds and can be painful, but I adjusted quickly"
219,"I actually really love the sony float run open ear...wear it all the time, running, cycling, at work...great all rounder if noise cancelling isn't a priority. If noise cancelling is a priority then the xm5 hands down...

221,My HT-A7000 has been running perfectly without problems before the firmware update to version 1.779 and right after the update there is a loud pop sound and the soundbar restarts.  It has now done that 4 times when I switch on the soundbar.  I can't predict the pop sound so can't possibly record a video of it.  Have switched off the power and pulled out all the cables and waited to switch on with cables again after 15 min.  Have reset all settings on soundbar and change hdmi cable.  And there is still a loud pop sound and the soundbar restarts.  The soundbar is connected to a Sony A95K TV.  Have contacted Sony support.

I bought a Sony Bravia X75WL recently, and either I'm watching TV Channels, YouTube videos or playing console, I notice that the TV has good quality but whenever the image is ""too quick"" there's something wrong with the image. I notice it much more when it's like a person's hands moving, it's like ""there's frames missing"" and the transition to the next frame is not the best. I tried all the settings including MotionFlow and changing HDMi settings, and nothing works..
I also had tried a few TV's at the store, watching some videos to see if it did the same or not, and 3 samsungs that I tried, did the same..
Can someone please help out? 😢"

240,"Basically the title. Really interested in owning a pair of flagship headphones and had my eyes on this series since some time. Would also like to know how long this pair will last me if anyone knows😅
(Any other brands also welcome, tho I know this is the Sony sub)
EDIT: Thank you all for replying with so many pointers, after going through all your comments I think I’d definitely go for the XM4. Appreciate all the comments, cheers everyone!"

242,"I cannot recommend it enough. WH-1000XM4 is the most stable headphone to date. Supports FLAC, best battery life, compact and small, lightweight, great noise cancelling, and sound quality. 
I would suggest you to buy it. It has the same sound quality as WH-1000XM5, except a few quality of life improvements on XM5. Either way, it's still a good product with great value."
243,"Thank you so much! I’d go for the XM5 but it’s just too bulky :// I’m just afraid about how long the XM4 will last me, do you happen to have any idea?😅"
244,"I didn't calculate it, but most reviewers has confirmed that 40 hours of play without NC on.
To give you some perspectives, last time I commute to college and return 1 hour via train. On Monday, it is full charged. I always listen with NC on while commute. At night, I listen some more music with NC. 
On Sunday, the battery life is about 30%. I charged about 1 hour and it's ready for use. Always remember, do not charged your headphone when you're going to sleep. It can degrade the battery life.
If you don't turn NC on, it can last for 2-3 weeks I assume."
245,"I think I’m sold, thank you so much!"
246,Nice to see someone joins the gang :)
247,"I charge it roughly once a week, and it rarely goes below 40% battery."
248,I'd pick the XM4 over the XM5s any day. Had mine since launch and they show no sign of stopping. Battery also still great even though I use them every day for work or travel or just chilling around at home.
249,"Same, heavy daily use, had mine for 2 years, works great, also tried the xm5 when it came out, I prefer the xm4, the NC on xm5 is just weird."
250,"Broke mine by accidently sitting on them, they still work perfectly even tho they are held together by electrical tape and super glue."
251,"Swapping my XM5s for XM4s, between the shallow ear cups and pressure point on the headband, it didn't live up to expectations. Here's to the XM4s being better."
252,"I wanted to upgrade my xm3. I got the xm5. I was memed into thinking xm4 was better, and also bought xm4 to test both.
The xm5 still got the most ear time. I'm sending back the xm4.
xm5 noice canceling is less stable but better. The sound is kind of better. The notifications are way better, no stupid voice. Connection is also snappier."
253,Oo! Thanks for the input. But foldability is a big dealbreaker for me. If the ANC is near about the same then I’d go for xm4 just because it folds. I hope the drivers stay relevant for a couple of more years
254,"xm5 noice canceling is less stable but better

How is it less stable? I have the XM3 and the noise cancelling never fails in any way. It just works."
255,"xm3/xm4 is kind of static, it always kind of works but it doesn't cancel everything
xm5 doesn't cancel everything, but it cancels more, when it really kicks in. But sometimes when you do things it adapts too quickly which kind of suck.
Still, I prefer XM5. But I admit that it's a tough choice."
256,"Yep I eq’d mine recently 
7,6,4,7,6
Clear bass +10
Some of the best ANC out there"
257,"Yes. Pretty much what others said. Great headphones, haven't tried the Xm5s but pretty sure I'd still prefer these. Folding is really nice. 
As for how long they'll last... I got mine in 2020 and they're still in great shape and I'm not very careful/precious with them. I regularly throw them in my bag without a case etc. Only issue I've had is the sensor (that detects if they're on you or not) needing cleaning and one time a dog hair got stuck in a speaker there was some buzzing and I had to open them up (not very hard) to pull it out."
258,Thank you!
259,Yes. Just bought mine few months ago
260,"I’m still rocking an XM2 which sounds great and has decent noise cancelling so … 😅
They are fantastic headphones"
261,It'll last you for over 2 years. Mine fell apart but they did their service well.
262,Did you keep track of the number of hours logged on the sony app? Just curious haha
263,"No, just tracked the day i started using them. I ended up with 766 days of service."
264,"Oh wow, interesting lol I see"
265,"Bought mine in 2020, still going strong despite me accidentally sitting on them and breaking the headband. They're held together by electrical tape n super glue at the moment ha!"
266,"Same here, headband broke from sleeping with them couple weeks after buying them almost 4 years ago, held together with electrical tape and glue, have almost 10,000 hours on them and they’re still going strong"
267,The XM4 earbuds are fantastic and I'd recommend them. I have mine now a while I think over a year or so. I use Wavelet this amps up the sound as the native volume for me is a bit low. The XM4 with Wavelet a powerhouse.
268,The fact that the XM4s have maintained their price very high while the newer XM5 keeps going down tells how popular and liked the XM4s still are. I’d like to get a pair too but they’ve been actually more expensive than they were like 6 months ago here. Go figure.
269,"I've had mine for about a year and I have no complaints. They're easily the best headphones I've ever used, and you can get them for well under 300 euro now, so I think that they're decent value."
270,"Yup, where I live it’s equivalent to 250 euro"
271,Got mine a few months ago and I’m extremely happy with them.
272,It’s wider head band would be a lot more comfortable
273,"Just bought a pair a month ago, was my first ever pair of wireless headphones, super happy with them definitely recommend it"
274,"If possible try Sennheiser pxc 550-ii, I gave my xm3 and took this, just for sheer comfort. I felt Sonys clamshell force to be too much"
275,"I think they are great! They kind of hit a sweetspot when it comes to weight, audio quality and design."
276,"Yes. The XM family of headphones have been very reliable. The XM5 seems to have more durability issues, but people seem happy with theirs.
I've been using the XM2 almost daily since 2018. They work perfectly fine today."
277,"Its a great headphone for day to day use. Sound wise, what type of sound signature do you want?"
278,"I’d like a well balanced one, maybe a bit more bass heavy suits the songs I listen to"
279,"I see, I have the same taste as yours too. What kind of bass you like the best? Tight, controlled, deep bass or boomy bass"
280,There was a time during 2013-2016 when I was all about the boomy bass. Thank god now I’m much more into tight bass
281,"Yeah, tight bass is better imo. You really need to try the xm4s in person, they are known to have a relatively boomy bass, just like what beats did in their old headphones."
282,"I have tried it before but it’s been so long since that, a year I guess so I don’t remember exactly but I know it was really something else. I loved the weight on my ear and NC was just * chefs kiss * 
Thanks for your input!"
283,"No problem, I believe you will make the best choice for yourself! :)"
284,"By default, the XM5 sound a little bit better, but that quickly turns around as soon as you start EQing. So far I haven’t found a Harman Curve EQ for the XM5, but the XM4 respond very well to being EQd.
Here, try it out for a day or two. It actually sounds like you have entirely different headphones on. In the beginning it might sound a bit weird, but the more music I heard with that, the more I liked hearing all the details and balancedness.

Credit: Reddit topic ""GUIDE: How to get best sound from Sony WH-1000XM4"".
That’s why I’ve returned the XM5 for now, since I’m very happy with that sound."
285,Omg thanks! Will get to this as soon as I get my hands on the the thing x))
286,"Yup, best in the market rn for the price. Go for it!"
287,Search the model number on the subreddit. If all the negativity here around the fours and fives doesn't scare you off then at least take the advice of saving yourself some money by buying a lightly used pair.  Durability is not a strength of Sony's within this product category. Daily multi-hour on the go use could easily lead to a snapped hinge with in a year.
288,"I did search it through, but I think issues with the hinge won’t be a problem for me, I have OCPD so keeping it safe is something I’ll excel at😂  that said, I just dislike how bulky the xm5 is. Thanks for the advise!"
289,I've had pairs of Sony headphones bust on my head under completely normal use. Obviously there are extremes of abuse where it's understandable if someone breaks their headphones but seriously even if you're a relatively careful person Sony's headphones break way too easily.
290,"If you never owned any flagship wireless headphones, I say you go for XM4's. I bought them even though XM5's were already coming up, actually it made XM4's price go down, so that was also a factor for me. The sound quality difference would be very small, also the noise canceling - both are excellent on XM4's. And big dealreaker for me was that XM4's ale foldable and XM5'a are not - didn't wanna carry the big case."
291,Same! I listen to a lot of music but definitely not enough to understand a huge difference between 4 and 5. If I can bag a similar product for a lesser price and foldable I think I’ll choose that. Thanks mate!
292,"Yep, definitely, bought myself a pair a couple of weeks ago.
Sound quality is great, battery life is the same as the XM5, I much prefer the clam shell folding action over the flat fold on the XM5 and they were over £100 cheaper as well.
Honestly not enough changes or improvements, and in some cases backwards steps in my opinion to justify buying the newer model."
293,I bought a pair of xm4's about a month ago.. so so worth it! Been using them daily and love everything about them.
294,"I got this new wh1000xm4, and oddly it came in with 100% battery, so i didnt bother charging it.
After a bit of use, it turned off telling me to charge the headphone, I turned it on and checked the battery, it was at 40%. What's going on? Do i need to replace it?"
295,I’m not really sure but I think it’s better if you do get it exchanged with a fresh piece
296,"I have almost 10,000 hours racked up on mine from the almost 4 years I’ve owned them, only issues I’ve had with them is just battery degradation(to be expected), and the dreaded headband plastic breaking a couple days after getting them, they are held together by tape and super glue at this point but still sound and work like new"
297,I’ve had the xm4s for two years now and I’ve been using them almost every single day and they still hold up great. I recommend them a lot.

316,"Great question and you're right about the EQ settings being turned off when plugged in. The frequency response curve when using wired connection should be the same as Bluetooth connection (with no EQ obviously). So whatever EQ setup you have in the Sony app can be applied on an EQ app on your laptop. Finding XM4 EQ settings is actually pretty easy if you know where to look. If you're on a Mac, you can download eqMac and that app has presets (based on the XM4 frequency response curve) for the XM4s. Its been a while since I've seen the preset curve with my own eyes but this one I've found online looks about right from what I remember. Give it a try and see if you like it!

324,"My Sony Linkbuds s right earbud has completely stopped working, and I am planing on getting a singular replacement bud. However I cannot find how to pair the replacement bud. The Sony website says I have to take it to a service center to pair it, but we all know that's not true considering that's what they said about the xm4s, yet it's very simple to pair a new bud. Any help appreciated

335,I am curious on the answer too. I want absolute noise canceling. I can focus so much better at work in silence.
336,Get the cans
337,Oh definitely the cans but 4s or 5s
338,If your ears aren't small get the 5's the 4s have a sensor inside them that pokes out and aggrevates my ears after an hour.  If that sensor won't bother you then get the 4s cheaper and very very close to as good
339,@sony - if anyone with real power at sony is seeing this most realistic pool should understand they need to make xm6 foldable again.
340,Poll*
341,And the sound quality and comfort guess
342,"Personally, I didn't like the folding design. The M1 and M3 both broke at the folding hinge and wouldn't stay on my head properly anymore."
343,u should really specify your use case instead of just a blank voting poll cuz the xm4s are easy to travel with while the xm5s are a lil bulkier
344,yes that's true!!!
345,"It's WH and WF not both WH
I also got WH XM4 for travel because it's smaller and can be folded and I got WF-XM5 for everyday listen when I'm enjoying a coffee alone"
346,I meant to put both WH
347,"well yeah in the poll it differed but OP had edited the post content, 'preciate ur breakdown of the pros of both tho"
348,"I have the XM4s and they are really great, definitely a better value too. I think I got them on Prime Day for like $230. They sound great, ANC works well and they're very comfortable.
I know the XM5's are a bit nicer but I don't think I've ever seen them go lower than $350 and i dunno if I could justify dropping that amount on headphones."
349,"I would suggest Linkbuds S instead of XM4.
If you want XM5 it's better to wait for a while (several months). I bought 2 XM4s when first released, they had a lot of issues and  Sony had a year to fix."
350,"You should get whatever you can afford. If you can afford xm5 is a better product. But xm4 still is a great headphone to have. I had both, maybe 10-15% different in performance tops."
351,XM5s are a downgrade in just about every way.
352,Easy answer... Do you want headphones or earbuds?
353,Headphones ( I meant to put both of them headphones
354,Delete it and start again.
355,"OK, yeah it was and will continue to be confusing since the wf means earbuds."
356,"The XM4s, without a doubt. Still sounds just as good and has all the same features for less money."
357,XM4s look way cooler imo....but that's a personal choice
358,"Long term? Use headphones WH-1000XM4. Best noise canceling and great battery life for years.
Earbuds? You google right now and see how many people complaining about battery life cut short after 1 year. The moment you want to repair at Sony Centre they charged you like crazy, like buying a new earbuds.
Edit: I just noticed you meant headphones. I owned XM5 and it's upgrade as a quality of life only. It has the same performance as XM4 in terms of sound quality, noise canceling, and battery life.
XM5 allows 2 devices connected simultaneously. Music paused when you take off your headphone."
359,XM4 also allows 2 devices connected simultaneously and music pause when you take off your headphones
360,"If I remember correctly, XM4 doesn't allow 2 devices connected. People want that feature for a long time and XM5 they finally do it. Plus how can it pause when there is no sensor on XM4.
Do you own XM4?"
361,"You probably confuse XM4 with XM3
I own a pair of XM4s and sensor is there"
362,"Probably it's XM3. Yeah, before that, I own XM3 for a long time. Then XM4. After 1 year, I use XM5.
Probably my memory remembered on XM3 still"
363,"How do you like XM5 design over XM4?
I think they look gorgeous"
364,"I like both, I'm always travelling so I really need headphone that fit in my bag. I missed XM4 design. It's compact and small. So I think I like XM4 more.
For me, I love buying new stuff whenever they came out. So that's that."
365,The XM4 has a sensor inside the left ear cup.
366,"Sound Quality is 70% of the reason I buy a headphone, XM4 is better on sound, and the ANC is already good enough anyway"
367,Owned the 3rd gen. The performance is great but honestly the battery starts getting so horrible after 2nd year that I just can't recommend any pricy earbud
368,"The 5s are better for home and work use probably, but the 4's travel better and are lighter, so you could probably wear them for longer without irritated ears"
369,"You can get the XM4's way cheaper/refurbished. To be fair, I have not heard the XM5's, so I can't honestly tell you if they're superior. I'm just not super eager to upgrade to the latest and greatest thing. My refurb XM4's are almost 2 years old and they will last me many more years. Save some money."
370,Refurbished XM4s for $199 is no brainer imo
371,Send link
372,eBay
373,Eh does it come in the box
374,"XM4 the XM5 is a horrendous design idea and trying way to hard to be Airpod Max's, I love new tech but prefer the compactness of the XM4s"
375,First solve your battery draining issues :/
376,"I'm guessing you meant to write “WH-1000XM5” rather than the WF-1000XM5, if the text that you wrote indicates.
In that case, get the XM4s. The fact that you can't fold the XM5 is a major dealbreaker."

Well a hurricane is about to hit Florida and Walmart was closed, so I tried to buy Armored Core 6 and it asked for a password right at the end of payment information and then I realized that it was still his email to the online part of the account and I don't know the password. I don't even know if that email is still active, and I don't really want to bug his widow about this.
If the email isn't active anymore, what can I do?
EDIT: I did it!!!!!! I looked through old emails and found an old password for his HBO login that we shared and it turned out to be the same password. What a relief!!! I don't know what I would have done without finding that"

394,"I have tried both - the difference in quality using LDAC (on best quality) on Sony vs AAC on Apple is so HUGE (in a relatively silent room from a FLAC source) that is not even funny - if you can't hear the difference you have no place in writing ""audio reviews"". Same as wired on Sony vs SBC/AAC on Sony or Apple.
That being said - in a noisy environment the difference will be much harder to notice, so for many (but definitely not all) practical purposes the difference is not that bad.
EDIT:
This settles it on ANC - XM5 kills the AirPods:
https://youtu.be/-zE1CsM-XLE?feature=shared"
395,"As an XM5 owner, I agree. The XM5s sound really rough compared to the APMs even when the XM5s are EQ'd well. To me as if the XM5's onboard DAC comes messed up from factory. My XM5s have extreme trouble with reproducing cymbals and clapping. Which isn't good since I listen to music with a lot of siblant sounds. The XM5s lack that subbass extension as well. It sounds plasticky instead of giving you that body/slam of the APMs."
396,"My XM5s have extreme trouble with reproducing cymbals and clapping. Which isn't good since I listen to music with a lot of siblant sounds.

My feeling was that XM3 was better in regard to internal equalizer, and even better was in XM1 (which was in fact MDR1000X not WH1000X). Some of that (but I can't guarantee if all) can be dramatically improved with a super-good player doing equalizing and DSP in floating point (I am super-happy with Poweramp)."
397,"I second the XM3 comparison. Have the XM3s and 5s right now. I've done back to back comparisons and the contrast is STARK. The XM3 internal DAC and native frequency response curve is better than the XM5s by miles. I first compared the XM3 with bluetooth vs XM5 with wired connection to my computer (with a 10-band EQ). Sort of a lead and follow comparison. The XM5s sounded just a bit better than the XM3s. The clarity was better on the XM5s but the XM3s were close behind. When I put the XM5s on bluetooth and used wired connection on the XM3s, the XM5s fell far behind. Utterly unfortunate."
398,Great review! You're one of the few reviews I've found that shares the EQ tweaks you applied to headphones when evaluating them. I'm also glad you addressed how muddy the XM5s sound without any EQ tuning. Definitely agree with the EQ tweaks you made to the AirPods Max. I felt like they lose a bit of clarity due to the powerful bass and dropping the bass by a few decibels is definitely needed. I'm guessing we have similar listening preferences so I'll peek around your site for reviews on the Hifiman Sundaras!
399,I have both. I think the noise canceling in the MX5 should be a 4. The AirPods are better in my personal experience. Overall I think AirPods are better. More comfortable and just do everything better.
400,No headphone Jack and lack of true Hi-Res audio on the AirPods Max is a very big downer you didn’t mention.

402,"I have a new Sont a95k I think it is. My receiver is a Yamaha rx-v379 for sound system
When I turn on my TV it turns on the receiver. As well as the correct receiver input. But there's no sound until I change my input back and forth on the receiver. It starts the receiver on Audio 1. Then I have to switch from Audio 1 to a different Input and back to Audio 1. It's easy enough pressing up input on the receiver remote then pressing down input. But my old Samsung just worked. I have the HDMI connections correct as well as the optical Audio connected. 
Receiver turns on and off with TV. Volume control works on TV remote as well. I'd like to only need the 1 TV remote and not use the receiver remote."

408,"Here's the list of movies on Sony's Movie Buff Pass as of late August 2023.
*4K titles are noted.
Listed the Rotten Tomatoes scores as well (keep in mind it can be misleading for older films pre-2000):

Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star (2011) --- 3%
Year One (2009) --- 14%
The 6th Day (2000) --- 40%
Legends of the Fall (1994) --- 57%
Stripes (1981) in 4K --- 88%
Country Strong (2010) --- 22%
Beverly Hills Ninja (1997) --- 14%
Vacancy (2007) --- 55%
Daddy Day Camp (2007) --- 1%
XXX: State of the Union (2005) --- 17%

I have to say, this is one of the weakest lists I've seen in terms of scores on Rotten Tomatoes. Also sadly only one listed title is in 4K, Stripes, but at least it's one of the better titles.
Cheers!

415,"I really like the concept behind the HT-A9, but there were a lot of bugs kinks in the execution. Really hoping for a v2 product in Sony's typical 2 year product replacement cycle.   
Do we know if Sony will show anything new at IFA this weekend?"

417,"I have the HT-A9 and I don't know at which bug ""bugs kinks"" are you referring to. Can you give an example?"
418,"Wifi signal loss. Not perfect Atmos surround sound/virtual speaker creation, etc. 
Lack of bass (without the expensive subwoofer, which should be included) etc. 
Basically after 2+ years, it's time for an upgrade as in a new model. Or at least software updates."
419,"The signal loss between the speakers happen but is really a minor issue, I use my system everytime, everyday and I experience a millisecond of signal loss like, once every month or something like that. 
Atmos is really good, not good like having actual speaker on the ceiling but it's really good, especially if the show is mixed properly. If you watch a bluray with proper atmos audio you can really feel things flying over your head.
Lack of bass without subwoofer is not really an issue, i mean, if you don't have a subwoofer what do you expect? :D 
I've had the system without subwoofer for a whole year and I can confirm that the subwoofer adds a lot to the experience, but the surround is very good even without it. But i can strongly advice to buy the subwoofer because it really fill the whole room with the scene. 
I think that they don't include it in the first place mainly for the price point, but also to give the customer choice about buying the bigger or the smaller one.
I have a big room so the SA-SW5 one is ok, but if my tv was placed in a smaller room or in an apartment I think that the bass would be too muck, even if set at minimum."
420,"Did you get the big one or the small subwoofer?
Maybe if a new model doesn't come out this IFA, I'll get them.   
I was hoping for a new model with a center channel as well.  
I'm actually going to use it for streaming like Netflix, HBO, Amazon, Spotify, Youtube Music, etc."
421,"The 5 is the larger model. That’s the one they got.
I have mine in a particularly small room, so, the SW3 is fine in my case. I just turned it up one notch higher than the optimizer had it."
422,"I've bought the bigger one, and is really good, the bass are very loud and deep, but in my room that is a pretty big room I tend to keep it only to 25/30%.
If you really like having shaking bass you can turn it at 50%, but going 50+% is a bit too much for me, only for the music can be good.
With Netflix the Dolby Atmos is really good, with Prime Video not so much but I think that they compensate with better image quality.
Obviously the best is with bluray but not everyone want to buy a separate player."
423,I honestly don't need much bass. I just want the speakers to sound full/rounded.
424,"Maybe watch some comparison on youtube, someone said that the bigger one give ""better"" bass, but I honestly don't know what that mean."
425,"There’s really nothing to add. They’re apparently releasing a patch this fall to make the A9 VRR compatible. After that, there aren’t any new technologies to justify a successor.
The new product was released last month. The HT-AX7 is clearly designed to fit alongside the A9, sharing the same design aesthetic. But it serves a different function than the A9 and is not a replacement. It is also super-weird and worth experiencing first hand if possible.
I haven’t had signal loss issues since the firmware update in early 2022."
426,Never heard of it. I'll check it out. Is it also 4 speaker setup?
427,"It is a portable Bluetooth speaker that has 4 speakers in the main unit and 2 detachable upward-firing speakers that can be placed anywhere to create a mobile sound bubble. It is marketed to be used in hotel rooms, but there’s a great YouTube video where the reviewer uses it while doing yoga in a park.
It is Bluetooth ONLY, with no way to conventionally connect it to a TV. It is designed to be used with tablets and phones. Runs for 30 hours on a single charge. $500. Wacky.
It came out in July but has been sold out pretty consistently since. I also haven’t seen it for sale outside of Sony’s site."

433,"Hello,
These are my first proper wireless headphones and I have to say that I'm very happy with them, but at the same time I have small, yet very annoying problem. Each and every time I restart/turn on my PC, headphones will connect to it immediately but it won't count as playback device until I manually turn off/on Bluetooth on PC and connect them again. I'm using Win 11 with TP-LINK Archer TX55E Wi-Fi 6 AX3000, updated drivers. Would love to hear some possible solution."

435,"I think it's more of a Windows 11 issue, as it happens not only with my own pairs of Linkbuds S, but also with my JBL Flip 4.
And I still have no idea how to solve it at this point."
436,"I just got this exact pair of headphones and am having the same issue on my dell laptop. Headphones showing they’re connected but when I try to play audio nothing happens. Your workaround of turning Bluetooth off/on on the pc worked. As soon as I did that, boom the audio started coming through my headphones. Really frustrating as I have had issues with other Bluetooth headphones including AirPods and A Poly 5200 headset. Seems as though there some issues deeply embedded in Windows’ Bluetooth systems. Unfortunately I don’t have another answer, I’ve read so many things online it seems like this will never be fixed"
437,"I have zero problems with my phone, but same thing happens on my pc/laptop (win 11/10) so it's definitely Windows related. It's not a big deal but definitely quite annoying. At least now I know I'm not alone with this problem and it's definitely not problem with my hardware so I hope we will find some workaround from Sony/other users in the future.

btw idk why but there is someone who downvotes every comment in this (maybe every thread on this subreddit), imo it's just sad.

I am close to buying the Technics Az80 instead."
443,"Oh I just noticed we're talking about the in-ear version. I have the over-ear XM4s. I don't really mind the mic being mediocre because I rarely use the over-ears for calls, I'd use my airpods instead, but for the in-ears, which are competing against airpods, it seems inexcusable for them to have a bad mic."
444,what about uneven drain compared to your XM4 was that fixed?
445,"I never had that issue with the XM4s or the XM3s, so I guess I got lucky that way. My left and right always wears within a few single digit %. Battery life is enough for a flight or gym session. So like 4hours at least."

450,"I've had my eye on this particular model for quite a few years but I didn't get them because my current pair of headphones still worked fine. Now they are on their last legs and it's time for an upgrade, however I cannot find the xm4s anywhere. No physicals stores seem to carry them instead only carrying the xm5s. Trying to get them online, I only find sketchy listings where I can't confirm if they are real or the condition. Maybe this is a Canadian issue as I see a lot of websites from the US have them but the import fees make it more expensive than just getting a new pair of xm5s. Did Sony stop producing them or am I just looking for them during a period of low stock? Does anyone know any place in the Vancouver area that still has the xm4s?
TL;DR I Literally cannot find the headphones anywhere aside from untrustworthy online listings. Are they just out of stock everywhere or did Sony stop selling them? Any store in the Vancouver area that has them?"

Would this affect the sound at all, and if so are there any other ways to mitigate the soreness? The XM5ms I got are brand new, could this alleviate in a week to two?"

485,"I initially experienced persistent WiFi issues with my X90J, which kept disconnecting and required soft reboots to fix. However, the situation worsened, and the TV entered a bootloop, getting stuck on the Sony logo and black screen. Attempts to factory reset the TV did not help, still stuck on a bootloop.
I reached out to Sony Support for assistance. Their response? Since the warranty is only for one year, I should seek local repair services—at my own expense. This is unacceptable, given that the issue appears to be a hardware defect. Sony should be responsible for the repair without any additional costs.
Frustrated, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I spent an entire night disassembling the TV. Located the WiFi card and disconnecting it, the TV booted up normally. I ordered a replacement WiFi card for $20 and installed it today, only to find that the TV still wouldn't boot. This led me to suspect that the motherboard might be the culprit.
I've decided not to order a new motherboard, which costs $120, and instead plan on using the built-in 100M Ethernet port. Upon closer inspection, I noticed that the motherboard is incredibly thin and seems to be of poor build quality. I suspect that the root cause of these issues may be defects in the motherboard's welding.
Extremely disappointed with Sony and the quality of their products.

496,"Hi,
I got Sony wi-c310 a few days back and bought it for its 15hrs battery and its perfect in every perspective but I am facing specific problem consistently and noone has asked this yet.
The problem is that, whenever I call someone, during the time other guy attends the call and till the call end, I hear continuously background noise very clearly from the earphones, literally like ambient mode has turned on...due to which i cant properly hear the other guy however its perfect on their side,so it's must be microphone catching noise and playing it in my like ambient feature but it doesn't have any such feature...so any fix to this?
Or I shall return it.
Any alternative?
Thanks"

503,Except its happening on my brand now XM5s
504,Okay? They were asking about the XM4s
505,Reach out to Sony support and get a new one
506,"Thanks for this. Now I can finally tell my father to not buy this crap. It happens to his WF-1000XM3. Battery issue and we asks for replacement battery to fix it. Sony charge high amount of money like buying a new pair.
The battery issues always happens after 1 year. The fact that we only have 1 year warranty, forced us to either pay ridiculous fee at Sony Centre, or buy a new pair.
I suggest, buy headphones. I've been using WH-1000XM4 and XM5s, it still hold up well after few years."

Im searchin for thicker XM4 ear pads. The normal pads press inside the earcup against my ears, which is why I always hear a rustle with slightly moving my head or jaw. At medium volume you can hardly hear this anymore, but I also like to listen some quite music where it is very disturbing.
Do you guys have good thicker ear pads where I do not have to do without good ANC?

532,Galaxy buds pro 2 are like $120 new on Amazon. So no would be my answer.

536,"Nooo sorry mb i mean the WH-1000XM3, the headphones"
537,"Yep, still got the xm2 and the are brilliant"
538,"if you are asking about the wh1000xm3, they are amazing, i have had a pair for about 2-3 years and they still work ok. although, make sure to clean out any hair or water droplets in and under the ear pads (the bit between the foam padding and the driver), as mine had a lot of hair and pellicules stuck inside, and i am pretty sure that that causes static and weird noises in the headphones. all you need is a flat head screwdriver or the plastic equivalent to remove the earpads, and tutorials are abundant. 
getting back to the question, the wh-100xm3 do not need a case, although the case is a handy storage solution and it contains stuff such as a usb-c cable (any works), a male-male 3.5mm audio cable (it has special shaped ends so normal ones might not work) and a plane adapter thingy, although i dont think you need it.
you do not need the case, if you wear it all the time like i do, but if you want to store it and protect it a bit i reccomend looking for a case on amazon"

554,"The pairing functions normally. As soon as powered on it will play the audio indication of a successful pairing and the touch controls such as play/skip function normally allowing me to control media on the PC.
​
The problem is it will always be very slow (several minutes) for audio to begin playing over the headphones as it is slow to appear as an option for output devices in sound settings, the touch controls function immediately on connection. Additionally it will frequently just not appear as an output option at all and require powering the headphones off/on again before it's recognized as an audio output device.
​
Another issue, possibly related as it began occurring around the same time, is that after being connected and playing audio normally for awhile it will sometimes begin to intermittently cut out. Something like a split-second audio cut every 5-10 seconds consistently.
​
Troubleshooting so far has included reinstalling drivers, forgetting and re-pairing the device, and a factory reset of the headphones.
​
I have owned these headphones for at least a couple years and this has only recently become an issue in the last few months."

562,"So just get off two flight total of 12 hrs and using the new WF-1000XM5 (earbuds not headphones) and i feel like it causes me headaches. To be honest I am not quite sure and need scientific explanation or if anyone had experienced this before. 
After got off my first flight (6hrs), my head got really painful, its like migraine but it is not normal migraine I experienced before, its like headache+motion sickess. Then few days later for flight back home I tried to wear the WF-1000XM5 again and the same headaches happened to me. I feel like this is because of the noise cancelling that is not balanced between my ears. After few minutes wearing the earbuds, the foam tips would not sit correctly in my ear (its the out of the box size, medium  iirc). This causes one ear has a good blocking of noise and the other still has some sound leakage, also this happen back and forth between my ears. Tried to push it in my ear but then minutes later left got loose, later right becomes loose as well. 
I tried lots of earbuds, airpods pros, sony xm4, bose qce2, and usually the original out of the box eartips fits me well and never experience headaches with them. 
Has anyone experienced something like this? Sorry if my writings not very good, English is not my first language."

588,Hello I just bought some WH1000xm4 and for some weird reason the noise canceling doesn’t really work too well. Like I can still hear everything around me when it’s on. I can feel/hear the seal  but I still hear stuff like people talking to me or my television playing and even my Nintendo switch on. So I am just slightly confused what’s going on?? Did I get a bad pair? Like my AirPods max noise canceling was waaaay better than these but I’m just confused cause I know Sony xm4 noise canceling should be better…should I get a new pair??

Hopefully Sony’s technical team may be able to support you, for a price, I’m sure. Although tv prices have come down, I’m sure a tv repair will be less expensive than an all new set"

I also highly doubt that my surroundings is the cause of this issue so anyone know what could be the problem here? I’ve read on few forums that condensation could be the culprit but then again I’m not too sure."

621,"Hello! I don't know if I'm in the right place here, but I can't get any further. I have everything from Sony. TV, Speaker System, Receiver that's connected to the Speaker & TV and a Sony CD/VIDEO Player. My problem is the following: I connected my CD player to my TV via SCART for Video, and via the red&white cable to the receiver for audio. My TV itself is also connected to the receiver via OptOut. If I now play the sound via the scart output instead of the L/R cable, the sound is very quiet but bass-heavy. But if I now output the sound directly via the receiver via L/R, the sound is normal, but the bass is completely missing. I have tested the cable with other devices - they work fine. does anyone have any idea?"

update: just contacted sony customer support, there is no way to disable it, u just have to live with it, and even if u turn down the volume on it to 0, the sound is still there, just quieter...stupidest fucking design ever, honestly if the outer casing on the xb13 wasnt such a finger print and grease magnet, i would legit go back to xb13, cuz the sound quality difference isnt worth this start up sound bullshit"

Obviously doesn't work with Netflix or any other streaming services but it's still useful. Just wanna know if there's a way to take a screenshot. I tried long pressing the power button but i only get an option to restart and cancel.

644,"So I have the XM5s. I've heard the Comply foam tips while slightly smaller (I think?) give a better seal etc as they take time to form to the shape of your ear canal.
Currently I have the Small tip on the left ear & the Extra Small tip on the right. They fit most of the time, but I've found them falling out (esp the right ear) unless I crush and smush them into my ears super hard which is very uncomfortable for a while. Very uncomfortable on a plane when you have air pressure. 
So a couple questions A) what Comply foam tips size would be the best? And B) do they fit in the case? I had SnugsGo for my XM4s which I lost (in a bag I left in a taxi, alongside the XM4s) but I'm really enjoying the freedom of being able to put them back in the case and not having to carry the Snugs separately, and take the headphones out and attach the Snugs every time I want to use them.
Snugs have a 3d Scan of my ears on record so I'm guaranteed a fit (the last ones fit perfectly).
But comply foam tips are also much cheaper. IThe US site has XM5 ones for $44.98 (£35) with expedited shipping to UK (5-10 days. Otherwise it'll take up to 30 days) compared to over £100 for 1 pair of SnugsGo. Yes SnugsGo will last longer (it's a silicon cradle for the bud shaped like one's ear, rather than a tip that goes direct on the driver) but I like the convenience of not having to carry them around and having to store them separately when Comply tips can be on the buds and go straight in the case like the standard Sony tips do.
Thoughts of which size to order? I don't really want to order the assorted as they only give you one of each tip and then I have to order additional tips."

648,"Probably 3-4 years ago was the last software/firmware update for this TV (understandable).  They cant be supported forever if the TV runs off Android OS.  Slowly Ive had to stop using certain apps, as they are not compatible anymore through the TV OS (also understandable).  Ive been swapping them over to use through my PlayStation through HDMI.  Going through the settings menus is painful, remote is delayed on registering button pushes on its own remote.  Ok, not a huge deal, rarely have to go in and change anything in those menus.  BUT now, even just getting the TV turned on is a chore.  Most of the time I turn it on and its waiting for HDMI signal, and it cant detect the PlayStation.  Not until I reboot the TV OS.  Getting it to reboot these days is hard as well.
Anyways, I guess my point is, I was always OK with the OS bombing out at some point, but the ability to detect any inputs consistently (even HDMI arc audio) is a huge downside to the life of this TV.  Do I just have to eat it and get a new one?  How long before that TV craps out?  Are there better options for longevity on these TVs that are based on a software OS?  Would anything be fixed by resetting the TV to factory and starting over?
Thanks for any input or guidance."

651,So recently I went to a shop to buy a sony linkbuds s. I was kinda suspicious because the package was opened already. but inside it was with package. So I wanted to check the authenticity of the product. so I told I need to see whether the buds will connect to the app. then the person in the shop took a call to someone and then came back and said that these are from europ because of that these might not connect to the app. Because there is a regional thing in these. is it true ? becuase the region changed can the earbuds not connect to the sony app. That is kinda suspicious???? So i need to check if it is true

658,"I purchased a 70-350mm lens from Sony directly. I paid with affirm. Upon receiving the lens I noticed that the plastic ring surrounding the glass in the grant was cracked. This bothered me so I contacted support and asked for an exchange. A case was opened and I uploaded requested photos of the box/damage. Before shipping out the lens to Texas, someone from Sony called me basically saying they didn’t receive the photos and also reconfirmed that I wanted an exchange, not a refund. 
I uploaded the pictures again and they confirmed that they received them. I then sent out the lens and it arrived to them on Friday 8/18. I didn’t expect to hear back from them over the weekend but I did expect something by the mid week. Now it’s been a week exactly and I haven’t heard anything. I thought maybe they ignored that I wanted an exchange and just refunded me instead but no, affirm has not  been reported a refund from them. This morning I spoke to two people in a chat, one said to wait for a refund by Monday or I’ll have to contact my financial institution. The other said basically just to wait it out. I feel like this is taking abnormally long for an exchange. At this point I will accept a refund."

664,"Hi, I can connect any of my phones via Bluetooth to my Sony HT-A9 to output audio or music, but I've tried connecting 3 of my windows PC's (10 & 11) without any luck. I have Bluetooth mode set to Receiver, which I'd think is correct since it works as intended with my phones.
When trying to add a Bluetooth device in windows, it finds the HT-A9 and it appears with a speaker icon, but it always fails to connect - even with the HT-A9 set to Bluetooth mode.
Windows does let me connect via the ""Everything Else"" option, but there the HT-A9 appears with a monitor icon instead of a speaker. It does not appear as an output I can use for audio.
Under Bluetooth receiver mode in settings on the HT-A9, it shows there's no Bluetooth device attach. Expected if it failed above right.
Am I just missing something really simple? Any help would be great!
i can add the HT-A9 as an \""everything else\"" device, but no idea what that even does. its not an audio output.
​
when trying to add the HT-A9 as an Audio device via Bluetooth, it'll try connecting for a long while then fail."

678,"Hey all -- I'm helping a dear older relative move to a new retirement facility and unfortunately we seem to have all her TV gear EXCEPT the power cord, which she was wrongly told was part of her old cable system and left behind at her old place.
I have the model number for the TV (XBR-55X930E) and the marking by the power port says ""DC IN 24 V."" Google results for OEM parts don't seem to match what I'm seeing on the port.
Does anyone know what the correct replacement part is or if it can be replaced with a generic part? The old part seems to have a heat sink, so I don't want to screw up with something generic that would overheat. It's a big, heavy flat screen, a few years old. Thanks!"

It wasn't like this when I first got them but now, about a week later, this behavior is every time I use them.
Just wondering if anyone has experienced this or have a fix. It's such an odd problem that I'm finding difficult to Google.

692,Apparently it rejects tips and discussions but accepts questions. Don’t add a pic of your EQ. It doesn’t like that either.
693,"Apparently it rejects tips and discussions but accepts questions.

That is not how it is set up at all and I wonder how you came to this conclusion by posting the same post twice? 
First post
Second post
Also all your comments are visible and were not held back by moderation. So no idea what you are on about at all.  

This is the only group I’m on that rejects complying posts for no reason, repeatedly. 

No it is not, stop spreading misinformation."
694,This “conclusion” was based on what actually happened. My first attempt was as a tip. It didn’t post. My second attempt was as a discussion. It didn’t post. Third attempt as a question and it posted. How many days ago was this? Get over it already.
695,"This “conclusion” was based on what actually happened. 

So a sample size of two posts - or are you already factoring in this post as well? 

My second attempt was as a discussion. It didn’t post. Third attempt as a question and it posted.  

You can see by the traffic stats of your second post that this is not true.

How many days ago was this? Get over it already. 

I should get over what? You made this post to call out the mods and the automod settings without having ANY understanding of how automod works and how ours is configured. So I say the same again as I did before - stop spreading misinformation."
696,"This is old news already. The only one to post originally was the question. If the moderators approved my first and second attempt after the fact that’s not my problem. There wasn’t a single thing in the post to draw a red flag or anything in it that goes against the guidelines. The only problem here was that it took three attempts to post it which is good enough of a reason to spread accurate information and share my opinion that the bot is annoying.

“If your post DOES NOT show up unless you are logged in, kindly get in contact with the mods!” ☝🏻THIS DOESN’T EVEN MAKE SENSE. get rid of If, capitalize the Y in your, then you’re speaking English."
697,"There wasn’t a single thing in the post to draw a red flag or anything in it that goes against the guidelines. 

There was a reason why it was held back and I don't need to go into any detail as of why.

☝🏻THIS DOESN’T EVEN MAKE SENSE. 

It does - if you go to Sony/new without being logged in and you can't see the post, it was held back. If you can see it, it was not caught in the filter.   
I will lock the post now, as you are being a pain in the ass for no reason - you could have had a discussion via mod mail, but you opted to post this post first and sending the mod mail after that without even awaiting a reply."
698,"It doesn’t like new accounts and those who haven’t posted here. Your account is less than 3 weeks old and had 0 Karma.
If you had any idea how much spam the sub gets then you’d understand."
699,"4 Karma and that’s good enough for every other sub. Also that’s not accurate, it accepts the Question Flair but not the Tip or Discussion Flair."
700,"You’ve only posted one other post on other subs.
Your posts here were manually approved and denied after caught in the filter. One was removed because it was a duplicate.
We get tons of spam including self promotion and affiliate links. 
You think getting your post to show up is a pain? Try filtering through all the BS that gets posted daily."
701,I’ll just use the question flair regardless of the type of post and problem solved. The bot still sucks.

720,"Hello all,
I've had my XM4 earbuds for 6 months now. 
Yesterday, my right earbud died. The touch sensor no longer works and it isn't detectable on any connected devices. No sound comes out of it. 
I did the 5x case opening thing and now my case blinks red when not charging. Also my case doesn't charge half the time. Is there anything I can do besides throw them away? I bought them in store and no longer have the receipt. I live in the EU btw. Worst part is I unpaired them from my phone and can't repair them because of the dead sensor."

Tried cleaning the leads and the connecter with cotton swab. Tried resetting and initializing as well. Nothing helped.
I thought removing pairing and retrying might help. So, I am unable to pair now too. It has been about 8 months since I purchased it.
Anyone knows what could be done ?"

724,I got AirPods instead because I knew that even though all true wireless buds have this problem the AirPods have got the most QA behind them.
725,Took it to the Sony service center. Got it replaced in less than a day.
726,"I had the same issue with my WF-1000XM3 and two pairs of WF-1000XM4 (mine and GF’s). Their battery started to last less and less (before 1 year of use) so I took them to the store for repair and they just gave me new ones because of the battery issues. This is a very common problem with this earbuds. They claim that they fixed this with the WF-1000XM5. 
Also, everyone in my family has AirPods (2nd gen, Pro’s 1st and 2nd gen) and we haven’t had any problems with the Apple one’s"

I registered using this link: https://www.sony.fr/mysony/product/register, and then I attempted to check the warranty using this link: https://services.sony.fr/supportmvc/fr/Repair/WarrantyChecker.

Has anyone else had this issue and if so, how did you fix it?
I’ve tried rebooting both devices, resetting the connection on the Sony app itself and still no avail. Perhaps this is just a design flaw?

750,"HI All, 
I have a sony camera RX100 VII, for which I use a 64gb version of this card. It works wonderfully and I have no issues with it. However I am about to press the trigger on the AX53 camcorder as I need something without video recording limits and am thinking about buying the 256gb version of the same card. Can anyone help me understand 2 things:

Is it compatible with the AX53?
Will I get top performance out of the AX53 without buffer issues using a V60, U3 card?

Why spend more on a card than needed?
I use SanDisk Extreme with a V30 rating for all my 4K video needs so far. The higher speed ratings are only needed for 

Faster sequential speed for photo series shooting
If you get a camera that uses the new 4K 120fps codecs like XAVC-I and XAVC-L on Sony professional and cinema cameras."
753,thanks that is very helpful. I will check out the V30

755,"Just bought a pair of WH-100XM4s yesterday and everything works great including the sound functionality. However, the bass (Clear Bass which I have set to +10) only works when the headphones are using Active Noise Cancelling. When allowing ambient sound and when ANC is turned off, the bass is very low, and it’s  annoying as I don’t want my headphones to drain faster by using ANC in quieter environments just to have a high level of bass. I’m using the latest update of the app and firmware. Any advice on how to fix this?"

757,"With most headphones, ANC typically does boost the bass. Probably not a way around it, but if you're on Android, you could use an EQ app like Wavelet to add some extra bass and rumble."
758,"Yeah, that makes sense, however, when not using ANC the bass is incredibly average, it doesn’t sound boosted in the slightest, which is what disappoints me. If it wasn’t quite as good I’d understand but it’s just very underwhelming. Unfortunately I do not use Android and switch between a Windows PC and an iPhone."
759,"How do you listen to your music? If Apple Music, you can go to settings, and there should be some bass boost presets. I don't know if it works with Spotify or Tidal."
760,"I use Spotify, and although there is an integrated EQ it often distorts audio quality, with my old headphones I just used an external equaliser and that worked fine. I think I’ll play around with a few different equaliser apps and see if anything makes a difference."

762,I had to replace my 7 year old Sony TV only to find my 2023 ONE also still is using a 100 megabit ethernet port!  HOW SAD! Why in 2023 is this still a thing!

764,Is there anything you could stream to the television that requires more than a 100 megabit bitrate? Or are Sonys now equipped with built-in fileservers? What am I missing here? :D
765,PureStream on Sony’s Bravia Core service requires a minimum speed of 115 Mbps. Looks and sounds absolutely fantastic on supported titles.
766,Not looking at that on this thing on ethernet anyway!
767,Okay that sounds nice. But I am going to assume they put WiFi in these sets but forgot to put in decent ethernet ports?
768,I’m not aware of any TVs on the market that offer anything but 100mb Ethernet.  It’s not just a Sony thing.
769,"Nah most people won't need it and to be honest I don't know how much it would add to the cost of the tv to put in 1000base-t instead of ""just"" 100, but I guess most manufacturers figure it's not worth it."
770,Your right they are crazy.  The Apple TV box is Gigabit.  I am sure many others are as well.  I am just pointing out that sadly you buy a top of the line Sony TV and you get a ethernet port form 1980!
771,"Why are you blaming Sony? 
If you buy ANY TV you get 10/100 Ethernet.. and as it’s been explained and admitted yourself, it’s because almost nobody uses/needs wired gigabit and there are other devices that can add it if necessary. Why would any TV manufacturer just WASTE money?
It would make the tv more expensive for 99.999% of users.
Just move on.. jfc"
772,"Wifi works fine for +100mb.
I have 1gb fiber and my Sony tv shows +500mb speeds with wifi"
773,Same here! I’ve never used the Ethernet port on my TV
774,"Actually, with so many of Sony’s offerings running GoogleTV (formerly Android TV) as their OS, you can absolutely run them as a DLNA or Plex server or clients.  4kUHD can absolutely exceed 100mbps while streaming depending on compression."
775,That's interesting. I didn't realize people compress 4K video with that high of a bitrate but the more you know. :) Thanks!
776,"You gotta remember too that the less compression used, the more authentic the file represents the original product.  Many audiophiles and cinephiles want “lossless” compression algorithms to truly take advantage.  This all supports your initial assertion.  Plus, those types are NOT as forgiving of frame buffering mid-content.  So between the higher bit-rates and signal reliability, wired is by far preferable, especially with the ever-increasing amount of wireless signals causing interference.  Plus so many people want as clean an install as possible, so putting equipment in closets or other rooms.  Wireless is good, wired is superior.
Of course this all supports the OPs inferred point that there is no justification for all A/V equipment manufacturers to have added or upgraded to the latest wireless connectivity standards and protocols while saving probably less than $10/item in cost — that could have just been passed on to the consumer w/o much notice or uproar — by moving to a 1Gbps wired connector.  I mean, I’m not trying to say that we should expect 10GBASE-T but 100BASE-T has been widely available on devices since the early 2000s.  1000BASE-T should have crept into high-end device over a decade ago."
777,"Hey I'm not dissing the idea of putting gigabit ports on every tv set out there. For some reason they aren't, idk why. 
And I get why people want the best possible experience, which currently to my knowledge, for consumers is 4K UHD blu-rays. 
And I also get why someone would like to have a server with lots of movies, instead of discs they have to load. Personally I love shiny discs but it's not just about me and freedom of choice is a good thing."
778,Oh I love the shinys!!!  I also know optical discs are fragile and in the U.S. the DMCA says I can LEGALLY have a digital backup of any digital media I own.  I legally rip all of my discs and then put them in away as an “archival” copy.  That way it is my backup that is most likely to be damaged/corrupted.
779,It's off topic but reminds me of you needed to back up floppy discs with your favorite C64 games or risk them getting damaged. Good times. I'm glad optical media doesn't wear by playing them back.
780,But that isn't a very common thing to do. A Lot of people who are buying Sony TV's are older people (at least in the area I'm in)
781,"Is it common as a whole?  No, I must grant you that.  However, I have to think that with all the changes in the entertainment space’s underlying technologies and specifications, it will only grow, especially with more tech enthusiasts aging, supporting open-source, and distrust in “big tech” growing. I have a 2015 Bravia (I’m in my 40s) and not needing a dedicated media pc while still having a reliable Plex/Moonlight client has been AWESOME.  I am surprised at how few TV manufacturers actually use GoogleTV or some other near-stock Android distro."
782,"Is there anything you could stream to the television that requires more than a 100 megabit bitrate?

Sony Bravia Core goes up to 150Mbit/s."
783,Does it? Sony Sweden says it goes up to 80.
784,"Some German guys have extensively tested it on a thread in the Sony community. IIRC the highest value was ~150Mbit/s.
Here is 89
But couldn't find the 140 something Mbit/s I recalled to have seen."
785,"I believe you, it’s just weird how Sony advertises something else. Maybe it’s different in the states vs Sweden"
786,"I found this on flatpanelshd
- ""BRAVIA CORE features Pure Stream which offers streaming between 30 Mbps – 80 Mbps. To access Pure Stream at 30 Mbps, you must have a minimum internet speed of 43 Mbps. To access highest quality Pure Stream available at 80 Mbps you must have a minimum internet speed of 115 Mbps,"" explained Sony
I’m gonna make a wild guess that there’s some wild tcpip overhead going on and that’s what causes the requirements for 115 Mbps to maintain a 80 Mbps stream."
787,"I am often perplexed when people’s initial reaction to something like this is to question the need for 1 gigabit in 2023. It is called future-proofing. If a HIGH DEF service requiring 100 megabits is released tomorrow, it will not be possible to use it on this TV’s native Android. Even Sony’s own streaming service, which requires 80 megabits today, will barely work on the Ethernet. You are better off using the TV’s WiFi because it has more bandwidth.
The TVs do support LAN connections, and you can stream high-quality video files from your local network that have a high bitrate and will not fit at 100 megabits. It is very silly for TV manufacturers to do this in 2023 because the WiFi is faster than the Ethernet on the TV.
As an Android device, you could connect a local SSD to it and use the network to copy videos and files. Additionally, you could have video files on your LAN that are of higher quality than what 100 megabits can handle.
I find it sad that one can spend $10K or more on a TV, and the manufacturers save $0.25 by installing a 100-megabit Ethernet port."
788,Look I understand all those reasons about future proofing and whatnot. I was under the impression that a 4K uhd blu ray with an average bitrate of 50 mbps in h265 would fit into 100 mbps but I can admit I was wrong.
789,Future proof?  Your previous TV lasted only 7 years.  I think you'll be fine for another 7.
790,"Just use wifi, there is no need for ethernets bit better ping, wifi works perfecly fine up to 1gbps"
791,"Wholeheartedly agree. My tv came with dead pixels and Sony nor best buy will repair it. They keep the pointing fingers at each other. 
I too recently learned it only uses fast Ethernet. Which really isn't as efficient as gigabit Ethernet. I've found it's better to have more room for bandwidth than you need than you don't need."
792,I use this usb 3 gig ethernet adapter and it works great https://amzn.to/3YJcI9r
793,"I purchased a USB 3.0 to Ethernet and get Gig speed.
<image>"
794,Great idea.
795,Seriously?!  Questioning what I think of Sony tvs now  and had planned to buy
796,"Jesus. This reads like a Trump tweet.
I don't really mean anything by that. It just has all the similarities.
Is society copying that manner of online posting?
HOW SAD!"
797,"Indeed they do, but this problem isn't unique to Sony.  None of the 4k Smart TVs out there today support gigabit Ethernet.
Multiple TV manufacturers use the same System on Chip (SoC) hardware, which you can basically think of as ""the computer built into the TV that runs all of the Smart TV functions,"" like Ethernet, Wifi, CPU, memory, USB support, HW codec processing, etc.
Both the X85J and X90K use the MediaTek MT5895 SoC.   All of the 2023 models except for the soon-to-be-released A95L use the same MT5895 SoC.  The A95L is the first Sony TV to ship with the next generation Pentonic 1000 SoC, but it's pre-order only right now.  Details aren't clear whether it support Gigabit Ethernet or not, and none of the reviewers have commented on it.  So... maybe?
https://www.mediatek.com/products/smart-home/digital-tv 
https://www.tvsbook.com/threads/2023-sony-tv-x80l-vs-x85l-vs-x90l-vs-x95l-vs-a80l-vs-a95l-specs-guide.8095/#2023-sony-tv-specification-table
Lack of Gigabit Ethernet is especially annoying as their own Bravia streaming service requires >100Mbps for its highest quality.    Or, if you want to stream 4k UHD from Plex.
In the meantime, I've had good luck with the TP-Link UE330 USB 3.0 to Ethernet adapter on my X85J and X90CK:   https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N9M32TA
Careful, as there are other models (including other TP Link models) that won't work with Sony TVs.
Make sure you connect it to the blue USB 3.0 port on the TV.  There's only a single USB 3.0 port.    You may be able to connect it to the other USB (2.0) ports, but you will not see 1 Gbps speeds.
The nice thing about this model adapter is that it includes a USB 3.0 hub.   If you're already using the USB 3.0 port for another device (e.g. USB storage), then you can connect it to the hub on the Ethernet adapter instead."
798,"even with gigabit LAN, i wouldn't run any of my exploits on Sony's bare android OS because the processor can't keep up. simple Plex use has been fine, maybe some live tv over the app or watching 4k movies streamed over google video has never been a problem with 100mbps LAN. my solution has always been get an Nvidia Shield Pro; much more processing power for anything i want to do. tiny features like gigabit LAN or whatever else is nice to have but i wouldn't use it anyway.. just like the built in tv speakers."

810,Just buy literally any Android phone with LDAC support (google it and it will show up if supported) and download the Sony app.
811,LDAC is good but it's far from perfect. Other signals around the environment can make your music stutter easily
812,I'm using exclusively LDAC while listening to music over Bluetooth. The biggest issue I had was when I lied down on my phone entirely blocking the signal because it was between me and a mattress with metal springs inside. It happened once. During normal use when I keep my phone in my pocket there's never been any issues. It's my 3rd phone with LDAC and I have 2 pairs of headphones and a tiny Bluetooth amp. They all work like a charm.
813,Thats not really an LDAC problem thats a native bluetooth problem. Bluetooth w/ Wifi enabled or lots of other local 2.4ghz sources will always cause interference esp on higher bitrate transmissions.
814,"My advice, get some cheap Android, root it, and use VIPER4ANDROID. It's literally the best."
815,"I don’t understand anything after “Android”. Could you explain it in simpler terms, or is there any sites I could look into?😅"
816,"Well in Android and IOS, you are not given ""full control"" of your device. Rooting in Android and jailbreak in IOS helps to gain the ultimate access to your device's hardware and software. And viper4Android is an app in Android (not in Play store), which is the ultimate app to modify sound quality according to your needs"
817,Thank you!
818,I’m also thinking about the AW-A100 Walkman. Would that work too?
819,"LDAC is from Sony so I'm fairly sure it would work just fine. You can also look into other portable players. FiiO makes some cool stuff, iBasso too, Shanling, and Astel & Kern too"
820,"Viper is just sound tuning, not that it actually makes the quality better 😅"
821,I have seen people using different presets that make it sound even better
822,"To each of their own. I used to like these things too when I was younger. But this is a little like adding seasoning to your food. Adding seasoning makes u enjoy more perhaps, but it won't make the meat quality really better 😂. After using the same seasoning on all food u have, one day u would want to get rid of it and have the real taste, and to get actually better meat 😉"
823,"iOS just doesnt support LDAC, but the thing is XM4 and most bluetooth headphones dont even have the technical capabilities to make full use of LDAC. Yes LDAC does sound cleaner w/ measurable & audible lower distortion & lower compression, but the XM4's arent even designed to have that level of fidelity in mind."

841,"It's known that for some reason Bluetooth on Windows can be a little... Annoying... 
When using teams with a Bluetooth headset for the most part connectivity and performance is unpredictable. 
A solution to this is to use UC certified headsets which comes with their own dongle that gets around the blurtooth limitation. 
Luckily I happen to have a jabra link 380 dongle which came with a old evolve2 85 headset I had. 
With the dongle you can load up the jabra software and connect non jabra Bluetooth devices 🎊🎉🎊 (jabra of course do not support this and tell u not to but I've had 0 issues)
I connected my Xm5 headphones and earbuds and now teams is solid for me 🎊🎉🎊
No disconnects, no missing audio, no undiscoversble devices.
When doing this your Bluetooth device connects to the dongle (so shows as jabra link 380 in the Sony app). With teams u also pick the jabra link 380 for input and output and everything just works 🎉. 
I knows it a long shot that someone as a spare jabra link 380 hanging around but I thought I would let everyone know that it does work. It may be possible to pick up a dongle via ebay but they are not the cheapest dongles around (but worth it for anyone who uses teams for work) 
*side note : Sony released  a dongle for the Sony linkbuds earbuds (UC) but I'm not sure if it can connect to any device. If it can then maybe this will work too."

847,"Hey guys, I want to purchase a new Sony camera for videography only. I was wondering if you have any input on which camera would be better, or if there was one better than the two I'm currently considering. 
I'm going to be using this camera on a tripod for food/cooking videography where light will be controlled, and there won't be too much motion. I will need autofocus as I will be zoomed into my hands and the food I'm working with. 
I'm considering the FX30 because it's strictly for videography purposes which is all I really need, but I'd also love some input in regards to which camera would be better for my very narrow needs. 
Thanks!"

853,I’ve installed an XAV-AX3200 in my car. Is it possible to transmit SiriusXM satellite to the radio? If so do I need to buy any extra accessories like an antenna or something else? The app will not work for me because I don’t get good cell signal where I live and in towns around me so it cuts out a lot. My car is older and wasn’t SiriusXM capable with the old radio. Thanks.

857,"Hi everyone, I‘m going on a long haul flight soon and decided to try out the headphone cable of my XM4‘s. It seems as if the cable does not plug in properly? Like it‘s pretty loose, looks like it’s not all the way in and gets pulled out even if I just pull it lightly. Is it supposed to be this way? Or should I apply more pressure when plugging it in? I don‘t wanna damage the headphone jack accidentally so I haven‘t tried that yet. Any tips?"

859,Just checking. :) So the straight connector goes into the headphones and the bent bit goes into whatever 3.5 mm jack you want. Make sure this is how you're using it. It should sit firmly and not fall out easily.

861,You’re welcome. Enjoy your headset.

One big difference (other than the size) is the change from audable descriptions of modes e.g. ""Noise Cancelling"" are now replaced by different beep tones. 
I find this a step back. Is there anything in the settings where I can use the descriptions as per the XM4's?"

A series how will they mess this up? Well I don't give a crap about ratings watched the first two episodes and guess what Sony has permanently lost themselves a customer since the PS1 era.
Slow claps nice job same with the resident evil 3 remake just because the one that comes after it is good doesn't mean you'll be able to make me open my wallet again, You had everything the resources to do something great but as always modern media finds a way to crap all over the consumer that made them great in the first place."

875,"Anyone else having this issue?  I consistently have to tap my right earbud twice to pause my podcasts.  The first tap makes the headphones chime or whatever but nothing happens until I tap again.  It seems to be time-based as I can then resume with a single tap.  But then later on I have to tap twice again to get it to pause.  Almost like I have to wake it up before it responds.  
It also seems like removing one of the earbuds doesn't always pause what I am listening to either.
Never had this issue with my xm4's.  Has anyone else had this happen?
Edit:  I just tested some more and it seems to be triggered by locking my phone.  After locking the first tap is always ignored.
Edit 2:  Just tried with my xm4's and they work every time, so it's not my phone (pixel 5)."

878,"Basically title. A bit more info: 
I use WH XM5s for gaming and connect them with the wire. This issue never happened until maybe three days ago and I've had these since April. When I game, (e.g. Apex Legends or Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice) they constantly sound off as if the touch surface is being used. If I alt tab to my desktop or G Chrome then the sound stops. It's also fine streaming Netflix/Youtube etc. 
Does anyone have solutions for this? Its endless and incredibly annoying. I've already tried wiping the surface down but it didnt seem to work. I also cut my hair recently so I don't think a stray hair is triggering the surface (if thats even how it works).

I have an XR55X90J that I recently connected to a Power Monitoring Plug and I'm noticing that with the TV in standby mode the power consumption is around 28W, even after being OFF for over 10 hours. Specs say 0.5W in standby.
Can anyone explain why the power consumption is so high in standby mode?

883,I can confirm. I have a Sony XBR65A1E model and my utility bill jumped $20 per month as soon as I installed it. I’m not technically savvy enough to answer your question though.
884,"I have a XBR55X850C and a A80J both with very similar issues. There are so psuedo fixes
I'm not sitting in front of them right now but in general here's the changes I made
A80J: (was 22.5W) (Should be very similar to your A90J) Luckily for the A80J the issue was mostly fixed and down to 0.8W (although I haven't measured long term usage yet I have a plug to eventually do it but just sat and stared at my Kill-a-watt for a while to see if it was dropping to deep sleep at all) by changing the following settings:
Remote Start: The Home Network setting (surprisingly you don't need to turn this completely off, although you can, I think the TV will still work for Airplay and Spotify even with this off somehow, but definitely does at the ""home network"" setting)
Eco Power Mode: Low ( I don't want it to heavily affect my brightness and IDK is this truly matters, but I set it none the less)
Home Network: Disable IP device control
Playstation Control: Turn this off.
XBR55X850C: (was 25W) This doesn't drop as low but does get down to ~3W. As this TV is older (2015) I think, I no longer use Android TV directly and I went in and completely disabled remote start, disabled wifi, disabled home IP networking. I also went in and manually disabled a bunch of android processes to clean up my home screen of all the advertising etc. ...This is basically a dumb TV now...but tbh that's fine, it can't handle dolby atmos streams properly anyway.
This was adding like $8-10 a month to my electric bill because of this....
I actually went through and tested almost every device in my house, and trimmed out almost $40 a month from my electric bill."

887,"So I recently purchased the WF-1000XM5s. I was very happy with my XM4s but they were lost/stolen. Unlike many others, I actually greatly preferred the stock tips to any third party solution. I’m confused though, Sony must know these ears tips degrade/compress over time…so why do they not offer replacements in their store? Seems like easy money to just sell the ear tips separately. 
Some people seemed to indicate that if you contacted Sony they’d send you a replacement but only if your device was still under warranty?
Main reason Im asking this is because I like the stock tips and would rather not wait till the product is out of warranty to snag more"

894,It’s clearly to force you to upgrade.

Anyways, Part of this upgrade was a Sony UBP-X800M2 4K blu-ray player, since my new chosen TV (A95K 65"") supports HDR and Dolby Vision. The player worked fine until recently, and now it totally freezes about 5min into any 4K movie I try to play. When it freezes, it's totally locked up, will not respond to any commands at all, even eject/power on the front panel does nothing. If I unplug it and plug it back in, it powers on automatically with a solid green light and freezes before showing the menu, once again not responding to any commands. If I unplug it for a day or so, it comes back and works for about 10min before freezing again.
I contacted Sony Support, they were awesome and said that I can get an exchange under warranty since I have my receipt of purchase from BestBuy. My question is, are these units unreliable as a rule, does anyone else have or have had this issue? I need a player that will be rock solid, and can't have glitches ruining my viewing experience. Also, wondering if Sony's exchange program is smooth or full of snags itself..."

I was listening to music at the gym, when I switched songs the headphones suddenly disconnected. It wouldn't reconnect when I tapped it in the bluetooth settings. I unpaired it and it wouldn't re-pair. Trying to reset it with our without a cable does nothing. 
After awhile it worked again, maybe the caude of it is sweat making the headphones malfunction, but now my wx1000xm5's power light is always lit up when connected to a device, and the light always lights up when i press on the power button, is there anyway to fix this?"

920,"Hello,
Every time I set the headphones to either 88.2 or 96 kHz with the A2DP drivers, I get this unintelligible static/distortion. This only recently started when I transferred my build from one case to another, installed an AIO and a few fans. It works fine on 48 kHz 2-channel (if 88.2 and 96 kHz are enabled in A2DP), but anything higher than that is pure static. 48 kHz 2-channel is pure static if the 88.2 and 96 kHz are disabled in A2DP driver.
I can post audio or more information if necessary and if this doesn't make much sense. I'm having trouble finding the right words to describe this situation."

939,"My Sony A7 II is giving me a camera error. At first I thought it was the shutter and had that replaced but it hasn’t gone away. I did figure out a partial work around is if I switch to 10 second timer in the first few seconds after powering it up, it’ll stay on and the error doesn’t show. Otherwise, I get the error after like 5 seconds. I’d prefer to get it fixed instead of hoping that workaround will work forever. I’ve tried all the fixes I could find. Didn’t know if anyone knew of a specific par to need to replace or anything."

942,"Ive had the XM5's for about a week now, and after having misplaced the case for a couple days in my room I think the next upgrade that should be included in the next one should be a UWB chip in the case so we can find the case just as easily as with the buds playing a noise. But coming from the Galaxy earbuds these buds are so amazing. Ive gone through at least 4 pairs of galaxy buds and they all suffered the same fate (one of the earbuds would get noticeably quieter all of a sudden). Decided that after my last pair did that I would buy a different brand. Since I've had a pair of WH-1000XM3 since 2020 and it's been nothing but reliable I decided to give the XM5 earbuds a chance and they have blown me away. The ANC is really good, the sound quality is higher IMO to the Galaxy Buds and the battery life is incredible as well. Im so glad I invested the $300 into these earbuds and hopefully they will last just as long as my Sony headphones have."

944,"Sound quality, yes.
Mic sounds, still shitty like all previous gens."
945,How did you manage you get them for $300? I see them at $400 everywhere.
946,The post is about the earbuds not the over ear xm5’s. $300 and $400 respectively.
947,Thanks for clarification.
948,"The ANC to me is much worse on the XM5s compared to the XM4s, unsure why tbh"
949,"for me its the size issue it does not fit into my ear in any way or shape tried every size. also the noise it blocks its weak, my galaxy buds 2 pro do much better. also has a much more comfortable fit which i miss on the sony's"
950,"Yeah it is weird, the XM5s are more comfortable for me, specially if I am in bed, but the XM4s have a better seal and they are secured in place tighter. I guess I´ll use XM4s for gym and transport and XM5s for work and walks"
951,"the xm5 are comfortable i'll give you that. the problem however is it does not fit for me, I love the foam tips, it just causes issues to my right ear. And yes i agree the xm5 do not seal that well i travel by bus (and train) daily and my buds pro 2 have a much better sealing than the xm5. guess i will stick to those."
952,"Which galaxy buds? I have the buds 2 pro, bought the xm5s and have been very unimpressed."
953,"I've had the original buds, the buds 2 and the buds 2 pro and they've all had the same issue after a while of one earbud going quiet out of nowhere. I've noticed the ANC is much better on the XM5 earbuds than any of the Galaxy buds I've used, and sound quality on the XM5s are on par with the Galaxy buds or even better."
954,"I've had the original buds for 5 years, and they still work great, though. Now I'm using WH-1000XM4, and I'm beyond impressed. In Bosnia, XM4s still cost a lot - $356 and XM5s are like $450, so I was like, hell no, they're literary the same, and XM4s have better design imo."
955,"Yeah I'd say noise cancelling is quite a bit better and sound with LDAC is abit better. Too many quality of life things the buds have that the xm5s don't for me though. Smaller size of case and buds but more battery, find my buds feature, better build quality (especially of the case XM5 feels flimsy), nice matte finish instead of the silly gloss. 
Also galaxy buds pro 2 are like $120 rn and XM5 are $300."
956,"Why is tech so cheap in the US???? 😭😭😭 I live in a poor European country, and I gotta pay a lot more."
957,xm5's have 2 hours of more battery than xm4's though.
958,And?

Unfortunately, I have no experience at all  when it comes to soundbars/home cinema and I was hoping that I would  find someone here who could recommend something good where work with the TV well.  Information  (about whether it is important):
I sit about 4-4.5 meters from the TV.
Maximum costs €600
Ceiling height approx. 2.5m
and as already written Tv is a Sony XR-55A80J Bravia.
I've  looked a little myself and have found for exemple  Bose Soundbar 700,  Bose Tv Speaker or  Sony HT-G700 3.1, but like i said i have 0  experience with Soundbars/home cinema"

964,"Sonos playbar Sony Bravia 4KUR3 (OLED)
Have had the tv and soundbar set up for about 3 years with an optical cable. Not long ago I realized that the speaker would not work and I’d had to reset the tv (hold power button) and the speaker and tv would functioning properly. Then that trick stopped working. 
In the Sonos app the soundbar can play audio via radio or Apple Music so I know the speaker is operating. The app makes it seem like it’s working; it displays the volume and you can see it change when you us the tv remote to increase/decrease the volume.
Troubleshooting I’ve done. All power cycles, checked for updates, changed the optical cable, unplugged all HDMI’s. 
I haven’t checked to see if it works on another tv given that it’s mounted. I just can’t seem to find if it’s my input (tv) or my output (soundbar) that’s malfunctioning… 
Any ideas?   
NEED HELP!
Update… 
I ran a few test and found it the tv optical port is not working. I connect the playbar to 2 other TVs and it works. 
I am working on getting another playbar to test the tv once again to verify it’s the optical port on my tv malfunctioning. I might buy a optical switch to hdmi arc"

976,I've been having issues with my Sony H7 headset being a little crackly with the audio. For now i set my USB transceiver in the PS5 position and that seems to have worked great for fixing the quality. I messed around with the Sony inzone software and nothing makes the audio quality better. the noise only happens for certain frequencies however the crackling is nonexistent when the USB transceiver is in the PS5 position. Anyone else encounter something like this on PC? I have a feeling it could be the inzone software since it cant run with the transceiver in the PS5 position

982,"I was super excited for the release of these, and I'm so glad I finally got my pair. Here's my take on them:
Background: I've had the WF-1000XM3s, then the 4's and now I'm onto the 5's. I also own a pair of the WX-1000XM3 over-the-ear cans and Pixel Buds A series. I've been an NYC resident for over 6 years, and one of my biggest reasons for sticking with these Sony buds is because they maintain a stable connection in what is possibly the most crowded RF environment in North America. Granted, I think the wireless earbud space has improved dramatically over the last two years, to the point where even my sub-$100 Pixel Buds don't have any connection issues.
Form factor & comfort: the buds fit very snugly in my ear and is a step up from the XM4's. I think this contributes to better passive noise cancellation. They also weigh less. The case is slightly smaller, which is a welcome change. In this category, the jump from the XM3's to the XM4's was dramatic (the 3's were super kloogy), but is less of a leap going from the XM4's to the XM5's.
Sound quality: The XM5's sound signature is quite similar to the XM4's but there seems to be some more depth in the midrange. Sound quality with ANC on is noticeably better than the XM4. Overall stellar, and in my opinion, superior to my wife's Airpods Pro.
Noise cancellation: This is markedly improved over the XM4s. The passive noise cancellation is probably the best I've ever experienced on any wireless earbuds, to the point where I don't even need to enable the ANC unless I'm riding a noisy city bus or flying on a plane. With ANC on, audio quality takes a significantly lower hit compared to the XM4s.
Software: This is a space where Japanese electronics manufacturers have traditionally struggled, but the Android app is reasonably intuitive. The EQ is a also a legit EQ, which I appreciate. I haven't bothered with the 360 reality or other overlay-type features. I also like the head gestures -- very Apple-esque. I'm surprised the Airpods haven't gotten something like this. Lastly, if you have an Android phone like me, the integration into the OS is pretty tight.
Negatives: My only gripe is with the case lid. For some reason, Sony can't seem to figure out how to make the lid not jostle around a bit. The lid on my XM4s was always wobbly and, while it's more snug on the XM5, it's still not perfect. Also, it should be $50 cheaper ($250 instead of $300).
Conclusion: if you're coming from the XM3s, upgrading is a no-brainer. From non-Sony, non-Apple earbuds, probably worth it in my opinion. From the XM4s, it's a tougher sell especially given the premium price, but probably worth it if you want the superior passive noise cancellation and better audio quality with ANC on.

984,"I bought them and I think I'm ill return them and keep my galaxy buds pro 2. XM5 have better sound and noise cancelling. If I were to spitball a number, 20-30% better. 
But in terms of the day to day buds pro 2 have them beat pretty much everywhere. Smaller buds and case but significantly more battery. Buds are more comfortable. Have a matte finish instead of the stupid gloss. The case feels, and in my experience is, very durable. Find my buds feature. And they're like $120 rn. $300 for these earbuds is too much for what they offer. Maybe the xm6 will hit it out of the park for me."
985,"hmm the lid on my wf-1000xm4 is pretty solid.
as for price, fair, but I believe Bose's upcoming earbuds may be even more expensive than the Sony's, at least in Europe. If the Bose are superior maybe the higher price will be acceptable but if they are no different in performance to the Sony's then the Sony's are now a better offer."

987,"Got this from Costco this afternoon, new.   Set it up and after 20 min it shuts off.  Have to unplug for 2 min or so to be able to turn it on again.  Same thing happens.  From what I can gather, power supply issue, maybe board.   Tried different outlet, factory reset, software is current, only have the one power cord.   Seems consistent with 15-20 min window before it shuts off.   Turned off all the power saving settings.  
Assuming just taking this back to Costco tomorrow is the play.  Unless I’m missing something obvious.  Thanks!"

- For starters, those who have it, or have had experience with it, what's your opinion on it?, is it a good product?
- What SD(XC) Cards work with them?, do Samsung and San Disk cards work with it?, I plan to use a 512gb SD card, but the Sony website says they recommend Sony brand cards.
- Does any .FLAC file work with the NW-A45?"

It’s also blinking orange when I try to charge it. Nothing gets sustained. If I turn the PSP the wrong way or move my arms too much it’ll just turn off.
Can somebody tell me what’s wrong and maybe how to fix it?"

1004,"I've seen posts from people referring to the Kinetis Bootloader showing up with the WF-1000XM3 case, and I have been seeing it occasionally with my WF-1000XM4 case. I'd be curious to know if this shows up with the WF-1000XM5s, but NXP Semiconductors - who makes the microcontroller that reports this as the device to a computer - have apparently superseded it with ""MCU bootloader"", so that may show up for XM5 users instead.  
Between my own experiences and the posts relating to XM3s, I think this is what a computer will report as the device if connected when the charging case is in its crashed, non-responsive state where the case won't even charge. It should be detected as your model of headphones when connected while functioning correctly.  
I've read a bunch of guidance suggesting various reset procedures that involve opening the lid multiple times, inserting the earbuds in specific orders etc, but the only process I've found that actually works is to try different sources of USB Power until the case is happy with one. It seems that if the voltage is outside of the expectations of the case then it crashes something internally which makes it completely unresponsive. ie: it won't give or take charge, and all lights stay off. I've had trouble on occasion locating devices that supply power in a way that my case is happy with to trigger it to restart itself in a fully functional state, but I have one power brick at home that works, and in my workplace there's a specific type of USB-C docking station that works.  
I hope this is helpful to someone."

1018,"Hi,
I  got a Sony TA-AN1000 home cinema amp a few months ago and today, I was watching listening to YouTube music with my TV and suddenly, a Spotify page displayed on the TV with music that was completely unknown to me and volume abruptly went up to 100%. I shut the amp a few seconds later, hoping it wasn't too late for my speakers.
After investigating my network for potential intruders, turns out the TA-AN1000 broadcasts a UNSECURED  Wi-Fi network and that allowed my neighbor to access my Google Home devices and start casting on them. I immediately disabled Wi-Fi and Bluetooth (because there's no way to hide the Bluetooth device) and renamed, hid and changed password of my main Wi-Fi network, just to be safe. One thing is sure : no more Wi-Fi for this amp, nor my TV for that matter.
I don't think that was intentional, I  noticed some devices tend to latch on unsecured Wi-Fi networks or it  might as well be a misclick. One thing is sure, it won't happen again.
I don't know if Sony will ever fix that, but it is a big fault in my book. There wasn't even a warning about that in the manual or something. Also, why not add the option to hide Bluetooth discovery ? I can only imagine neighbors (un)intentionally connect to random devices in the building. This is so dumb."

In my experience, during black friday, offers that are discounted are bought out almost instantly and the rest seems like a deal, but is actually more expensive than rest of the year."

1035,"My XM5 is always connected to my PC and Phone simultaneously and I switch the audio between them using SONY's app on my phone. 
However, after getting the latest firmware update. XM5 and Spotify no longer work well together. Even if I close the Spotify app on one end, the other end will still keep pausing my audio every few seconds. The only way for Spotify to play audio normally is to disable ""Connect to two devices simultaneously"" which mean my XM5 can only connect to one device now.
I'm pretty sure this is SONY's issue as my other headphone doesn't do this. (Jabra Elite)"

It’s kind of annoying to know and experience how good they can be( the deep bass, the feel of audio separation and defined vocals despite volume levels) then notice all that disappear to  a flat sound with deep bass on top when you try to listen from iPhone. I thought it was a phone issue but from an x to a 14 pro , it remains the same. Any one else notice this ? Any explanation would be appreciated… or what I could do about it. Have a nice one."

1060,"As it is a Saturday and Sony's custumor support is closed, I thought I'd try my luck here.
I've owned an STR-DN1070 receiver since 2017 and it's been the best piece of equipment I've owned. But now, it suddenly has an error. 
As of the moment of writing, It's been ten hours since I last used it without issue. Then, a couple of hours ago, I wanted to turn it on again, and got the error message [PROTECTOR]. According to the manual, this is a problem with a power surge or malfunction. I tried all the suggested troubleshooting. And even without anything connected, I still got the error. 
There's no blockage of ventilation, no fluids came inside and I don't see any fuses or capacitors that have either blown or leaked (I took the top cover off, careful not to disturb any wires or components). I don't see any burns, nor do I smell anything burnt or molten.
It's a bit dusty, but even after blowing the biggest chunks (and some dead bugs) away, the problem persists.
I don't know if this is the proper sub for this issue, or if anyone knows anything to help me. 
I'm very proud to own this, because I had to save a lot of money and work really hard to be able to buy this back then. And it might sound silly, but due to that it's also got some sentimental value to me.
Any and all tips or advice is welcome.
Thank you in advance.
(Apologies for any errors in grammar or spelling)"

1063,"So i've been using the XM4 for about a year now and loving it so far
My setup includes the headphones plugged into an interface (Kurzweil Unite 2) which is plugged into my pc
I have come to notice a very irritating problem tho in certain games. When using this specific setup, audio coming from certain directions is mute and/or can only be heard as reverb in certain games (Halo infinite and valorant) or doesn't work at all (forza horizon)   
Note that this is ONLY when i plug my headset through the interface, using the case's audio inputs is functional, yet very inconvenient for me
I'm not using any 3rd party software to manage the sound like windows sonic, or even sony's software (if there's one idk)
My guess is that some audio gets sent through audio channels that aren't there, is there a way to force stereo channeling?"

1066,"Hi Sony subreddit. You might remember me from my previous question about purchasing the WF-1000XM5. I've decided to not go through with it.
Instead, I'm looking to upgrade to a newer over-ear XM model. Specifically buying them 'second-hand' (by that, i mean unopened and unused ones from private individuals for a noticeably lower cost, I've spotted an unopened XM4 for 182$, and 265$ for an unopened XM5).
My question is, is the XM4 or XM5 better. These will my daily drivers for public transport commuting (mostly by bus) for at least 3-4 years (where i plan to purchase the potential XM7 if they're still producing successors). So ANC, battery and sound quality have to be at least marginally better than my current XM3s.
Any suggestions from you guys?"

1068,I can say from my experience that WH1000XM5 has terrible ANC. Im propably returning them and buying XM4 instead.
1069,"That's weird, in my opinion the ANC is totally brilliant. I think it's the best usp of the headphones. I might think you didn't find out how to use the ANC or there is a problem with your particular product. It's not to be harsh to you, I really just cannot believe someone experiences the ANC of the XM5 as bad."
1070,"Its not like my requirements for this headphones were stupidly high, but when its ANC is only slightly better than my 2 years old Huawei Freebuds 4i then sth is really wrong."
1071,are your ears fully enclosed by the ear pads?
1072,"Yeahh, of course. I also gave them to my 3 friends to try this ANC and their opinions were pretty much The same"
1073,"Never messed with the xm4, but I will say my xm5 is worth every penny."
1074,"I chose to buy XM4 last week for a few reason's, tested them both in shop and did a lot of reading up first and came to the conclusion that the sound was not really massively improved on the XM5, the battery life is the same 30 hours and I prefer the clamshell folding on the XM4 to the fold flat on the 5's which just takes up more space in my bag. And of course XM4 cost £100 less."
1075,XM4 are the best
1076,"I have a pair of xm4 and they’re brilliant. I will note that if you have sensory issues with treble and you want to use transparency it’s probably good to take it down a notch (I have it at 15) because it’s quite treble heavy, other than that they are absolutely fantastic! 
Can’t really talk about the xm5 because I don’t have them but I heard they got rid of some features that I find quite useful and changed the frequency response a tad to get a slightly more bass boosted sound, but you can change that in the app."
1077,"Never have xm4 but i have xm5, and the problem is that it needs large space in my bag"
1078,"I have both.. I loved the XM4s but I can only wear them for about an hour.  The in ear sensor hits my ear in a weird spot.  If that wasn't an issue I would have kept them (gave them to my gf).  The XM5s are an upgrade and I like how they are lighter but feel more premium.  Also the XM4s fold better but it depends how you want to store them.  So.. in your situation I would recommend the 5s because you can't return them if purchased from an individual, but if you can try them on and the 4s are comfortable go with them..."
1079,"both the xm4s and xm5s are great upgrades from the xm3s. but if you're looking for a big jump in anc quality, battery life and sound quality, the xm5s is gonna be a better choice, if ya can stretch your budget. 
however, one thing to consider is that both these models are pretty new. So the xm4s are still an amazing option, especially at that price, and they do have most of the features that the xm5s have. 
Also, keep in mind that buying second-hand from private individuals can be a bit tricky. make sure to verify that everything's in order and maybe ask for a proof purchase, if possible, just to be sure. 
Hope that helps. hit me up if you have any more questions."

1086,"Pro tip: you should give your ears a chance to adapt to the new sound signature, every new headphones would sound weird and worst than the one that you had which your ears got used to."
1087,"pretty sure you're right, on some songs they sound really good and others not too much i might js have to adjust to them. Thanks for the help"
1088,"Still, they are on the rumbly side in terms of bass balance imo, so if you come from a set with ""poor"" bass balance it'll be even more of an adjustment. That goes for below 400 freq range, so try to turn clear bass all the way down and notch up stepwise to see if you find a balance where the vocal pops like you're used to. Then you know the dB offset between bass and midrange roughly. Knowing that there's many ways to spend that offset energy between frequencies and volume to hit the sweetspot. Though I have to admit I haven't checked exactly how the sliders scale in the apps UI, if they're not linear you can't trade notches equally, if you know what I mean."
1089,Thank you good sir!
1090,You’re welcome ☺️
1091,I don't think anyone should get used to the Sony sound signature. Better to EQ to be more neutral
1092,"You just have to adjust. And bear in mind for me, they aren't as punchy as my sennheisers on certain tracks (had MW2s) but they sound cleaner. Noticed on certain tracks I was hearing instruments with more clarity and love them now.
I love rock and certain segments guitars didn't sound as ""powerful"" but they are certainly clearer. Had to get used to the lower sound.
Still feel a little bit quiet than I'd like but it is what it is. Sennheisers build quality is piss poor which pushed me away from their true wireless range sadly. But I will take the slightly less punchy sound for cleaner sound, much better battery life and build reliability. Plus they look great. No buyers remorse for me! :)
I also would highly recommend using your phones audio enhancement features and also playing around with a custom eq rather than the presets as they for me wash out certain genres depending on the eq, which makes it very annoying to constantly switch it hetween genre's that play for me. So just play around with it :) also enabling sound dampening really really helps."
1093,"Thanks for your input and yeah same reason why i bought these, sennheiser cheaps out on build quality which is a shame because i love the sound."
1094,"No worries, I had the exact same feelings at first and came from sennheiser too so thought my experience might be relatable. Yeah it's a shame because out of the major brands imo sennheiser have the BEST audio at least for the profile I like, but tbh they're all pretty good at high end mostly just personal preference/sound profile. It's very frustrating. I've owned Momentum 1s 2s and 4s and these mtw2s, but finally switching to Sony for that reason. Its no good having marginally better audio if the things don't reliably play your music. Maybe in future they'll re assess their approach to quality control and ill move back, but for now I'm very happy. Tested Samsung and airpods vs these and I preferred these overall."
1095,"Have you tried the automatic EQ? I thought they sounded disappointing (but not bad - on par with/slightly worse than the XM4s) for the first hour or two, then tried the auto EQ and it made a gigantic difference and now, to me at least, sound leagues better than the XM4s."
1096,what is the auto eq? and how do i turn that on?
1097,"Concept of AutoEQ:

Headphone Variance: Every headphone model (and even individual units) can have slight variations in how they reproduce sound. Some might emphasize bass, others might bring out vocals more, and some might have sharp highs. This isn't always a design flaw; often, it's a deliberate tuning by the manufacturer based on what they believe will be pleasing to most listeners.
Ideal Sound: In audio science, there's often a reference or ""flat"" sound signature considered ideal, meaning no frequency is unduly emphasized over others. This ensures that the audio is played back as it was intended to be heard by the creators. While ""flat"" is a technical ideal, some listeners might prefer a little more bass, treble, or mid-range based on their personal tastes.
Objective Measurements: With advanced equipment, it's possible to measure how headphones reproduce frequencies across the audible spectrum. By comparing the output of headphones to a target (often a flat) response, discrepancies can be identified.  
AutoEQ provides EQ settings that are designed to correct or modify the sound signature of headphones to align more closely with a target response. If a headphone has too much bass, the EQ might reduce it. If it lacks clarity in the mids, the EQ might boost it."
1098,i didn't read ur other comment mb thanks for the help tho!
1099,This is a good point too. I also found automatic eq much better.
1100,Change eq settings
1101,"THIS!
I was super-shocked how much more bass was in XM4 compared to XM3, but with the right equalizer things got to a very good neutral sound. I have not yet tested the XM5 (to be honest I am waiting for XM6 but that could take some time) but I would be surprised if it did not have the same insane amount of bass - which I am afraid is what too many of the buyers are expecting  today :("
1102,XM5 has decent bass like more natural
1103,"You have to adjust!! But even if you don’t, that’s totally okay. I think different sound signatures appeal differently to different people, that’s why so many headphone reviews can be all over the place. I love my XM5s and thoroughly enjoy the sound, but I can see how they’re not the most appealing sound signature for everyone. What genres do you usually like to listen to? Do you have a good return policy on where you got them from? Keep them for as long as you can before returning them, and if you still don’t like them, try another type of headphone!"
1104,"Like everyone else is saying, don't use the default eq or the preset ones.. YOU need to make one.. there are tons of people who already have optimal presets out there for you to look at.
​
Make sure you're using your highest audio code, download an EQ like Poweramp or just do adjustments in the Sony App."
1105,im sorry but what do you mean by audio code? Is this a setting on the sony app?
1106,"Sorry, Codec*
You can find this in the developer settings on Android. Sony Headphones can use LDAC (which is basically high resolution audio)
System > Developer Options > Bluetooth Audio Codec, set to LDAC when connected to headphones.
If you're on iPhone I don't know how this works though"
1107,Where are these optimal builds?
1108,"AutoEq, you'll find a lot about that on r/headphones
Poweramp and Wavelet have these built into them so you can access them easily.
Though you should remember just go for what sounds best to your ear. Find where the XM5's are lacking in your EQ.
The good part about them is that they are highly adjustable."
1109,"Here's a sneak peek of /r/headphones using the top posts of the year!
#1: here are all of my headphones | 207 comments
#2: Good Old Days | 329 comments
#3: First ever Sennheiser HE-1 Unboxing, Owner Review and AMA… (was it worth $59,000?)

1110,Thanks!
1111,"If you're into getting the best sound from your headphones, consider checking https://autoeq.app/. It offers tailored equalizer settings based on objective measurements of various headphones (most accurate ones are usually from oratory1990, but rtings and crinacle ones are also good).  Just download the txt file and use it on any application that supports importing, some apps already have these in place.
I use Wavelet on my android, Peace on Windows and EasyEffects on my Ubuntu
Using such files ensures:

Balanced Sound: Fixes frequency imbalances in your headphones.
Device Consistency: Same great sound whether on phone, PC, or other devices.
Objective Approach: Settings are scientifically derived, not based on personal bias.
Customization: Besides the base settings, you can still apply tweaks on top of it and shape the sound to your liking."
1112,do you recommend any sony eq along with the auto eq? Because the current one i feel like they mess with it mroe thasn they help auto eq
1113,You don't want to apply two eqs on top of each other
1114,"Yea I also agree with this. I've only used Dolby Atmos + auto EQ combined, other than that I prefer using a single tool to customize the sound. Because applying multiple EQs can boost or reduce the same frequency range that leads to a sound that's too boomy, too tinny, or missing elements altogether. It can reduce audio quality, introduce phase shifts in the audio, clipping etc"
1115,"I was in the same boat as U when I got mine... I made a post about it and shared a few EQs that could help if you want to try them (end of the post).
Here is one that can help with to get more brightness"
1116,I had a similar problem and it was the device I was using try a different device or update your sound drivers if on PC. Recommend listening on android.
1117,"EQ settings are really a make or break with sony headphones in my experience, play around with them till you found something that suits your needs (or watch a youtube video on eq settings)"
1118,Should I stick with my xm4 then ?
1119,"Just got the xm4s recently and honestly they don't sound great, EQ helps, but it can only do so much. I was expecting a lot more for the price, coming from mostly using audiotechnika headphones for years. What I'm trying to say is, i think it's probably not a downgrade from the xm4 so if you're happy with those it should be fine, but I'd personally recommend looking around a bit more. The build quality, the noice cancelling is great on xm4s, but the sound is just not there to be honest, and i suspect xm5s are similar."
1120,"To be fair, AudioTechnica mostly targets a specific group with their audio stuff. Sony is a lot more of an 'appeal to the masses' company when it comes to their headphones. Sony will sound naturally worse to somebody coming from AT or Sennheiser's, so there's no surprise there."
1121,"You're comparing Sennheiser default sound signature with Sony. Sony is going to be very bassy and veiled in comparison
I boost treble and bring down bass, the sound is still off but better than default"
1122,True I was thinking to buy xm4 over ear ones to I have the tws xm4 maybe I should buy crusher evos but that lacks noise cancellation as I'm a bass head anyone can suggest is xm4 over ear worth it or I should go for crushers evo which lacks anc ! But the bass on evo is to on another level as I have heard from everyone .
1123,I had to return mine they were too uncomfortable!
1124,"I recently bought XM4 and yes out of the box they were bad, muddy and sounded unlike 250$ headphones.
If you have Android, go to Bluetooth settings, disable Use for Calls option (the problem is if you use it for calls it switches to lower quality audio and music sounds bad). Enable LDAC. Go to Developer options change bit rate for LDAC to 990kbps. 
If you have an iDiotPhone, I can't help you as the max codec it supports is AAC.
See if you can download FLAC files from Torrent. Or there are websites with FLAC samples. Compare them with songs on Spotify/Youtube Music you'll see the difference.
Also burn in your xm5, play at 70-80% volume for 30-45 mins. (don't listen to them on higher volumes, put them aside while you are burning in your headphones)
Play around with EQ settings in the Sony app, the presets are okay. Tailor the sound to your liking."
1125,Give it a few days at least. New headphones always sound weird to me and then after about a week I’ve adjusted to the sound and get that fullness. I think it’s more of a brain thing than anything else. These are great headphones - there’s a reason they are the best reviewed ones in their price class.
1126,"I'm also having the same feeling with WH-1000XM5.
I tried the XM3 and loved it but I was reluctant to spent on it. Then tried the XM4, it felt really muddy for me. Then came XM5 which there's so much review saying how good it is. I got mine as bundle gift with Sony Xperia 1 V. Was really looking forward to it but a bit disappointed with the result out of box. It felt really muddy, compressed and the noise cancellations is not as good as XM3. I find XM3 sound really wide, open and bright with really good noise cancellation. I managed to get better sound with some EQ using Sony apps but it never get me the wow effect on XM3.
This is pure example of don't change what's not broken (especially the sound signature that earn you the attention in the first place)."
1127,Out of the box the profile is horrendous. Adjust the EQ with the app or search a good custom one online and it’s amazing!
1128,"I have the MTW3, and I bought a refurb XM4 at a good price to try out for comparison.  That hollowness could be a sign that you are not getting a good seal or fit from the tips. I found that the Large Sony foam tips still were to small for me to get good sound. I tried Comply tips and had the same issue.
I just bought the Spinfit CP360 in size XL. For me they made the XM4 sound much better, I actually get a solid seal.  Without them, the XM4's just would not work out for me.  I just tried them on the MTW3, they also make it easier to get a good fit on my MTW3.
After trying the Spinfits on both, and using the apps to do a fit test to make sure I had a good seal, I think prefer the sound of the MTW3. But both have a lot to like when you can get the right fit. I think the XM4's are still a bit big for long term comfort, I would love to try the more compact XM5's some time!
The Spin fit XL's are stated as 13mm wide. Even though they are ""XL"", they appear to be the same width at the back as the ""L"" tips that came with the MTW3. The main difference is that Spinfits are deeper front to back yet still fit in the case just fine. That extra depth makes it easier to get a good seal and remind me of the tip shape that always came with the wired earbuds (and wireless bluetooth ear buds that were connected to each other.)"

1130,"Hello, 
Ive been using an old external drive for vidoes on my a80j 77"" sony tv with no issues at all plugged into the usb 2 port on the side. I decide i want to upgrade that so i buy a 2tb samsung external ssd, and now all my 4k videos are buffering every 20 sec. 
In Windows ive set the drive to use the drive as internal cache to prevent the buffering, but with no succes. if i plug it into a windows pc using a usb 2 port it plays just fine, no buffering. Anyone that have a possible sollution?"

1132,Maybe it is an issue with the Player you use on the TV. Have you tried downloading VLC Player?
1133,"i have tried both the internal player on the tv, and kodi. same issue. No issues when i use an old external hdd, only when playing from the samsung ssd. No issues when playing on a win pc from the samsung ssd."
1134,"In Windows ive set the drive to use the drive as internal cache to  prevent the buffering, but with no succes.

That only works for Windows devices, not the TV.
Are you sure the USB port on your TV is providing enough power to power the SSD ? Is it a USB 2.0 or 3.0 port ?"
1135,It is a usb 2 port. I do not know the power requirements for the ssd. Its a Samsung t7 2 tb. But on the pc it works flawlessly Using the usb 2 port.
1136,"This SSD seems to be rated between 2,5W (0,5A) and 7,5W (1,5A) which is above typical external SSD power draw.
The USB 2.0 host specification states that a port has to output 500mA (0,5A) of power.
Most desktop PCs have a beefy 5V power rail, as it can be used by a lot of devices at the same time. It is expected to have it exceed the maximum power allowed per port, as 1,5A USB ports were added as part of the standard later.
But on laptop and embedded devices, this is another story. Their power supplies are small and designed to output the strict minimum the device needs to operate fully. It is not surprising to see more power hungry USB 2.0 devices not working on these.
So your issue here, is that you are using a high performance Type-C external SSD, which expects to be plugged on a USB 3.1 port and support Gen3 2x2 standard. That's why it needs that much power to work properly. While the power draw is technically limited by the fact you restrict it to the horrendously slow USB 2.0 norm, its controller can still have a spiking power draw when filling its memory buffer, which is probably why you are sometimes encountering issues with it plugged on your TV.
So, the short answer is : your SSD is ""too good"" for your TV. A regular SATA SSD in a USB 3.0 case would have worked better, while being cheaper. In your case, that's still a waste because these can be over 10x faster than a USB 2.0 port, so you might as well stick to a spinning drive."
1137,"Ty for Helping out ☺️ i have returned the Samsung ssd, so no money lost there, and now i know the issue. The only reason i didnt plug it into the usb 3 port on the TV, is because its unreachable since its on the back and the TV is Wall mounted. Guess ill look into setting up a NAS instead."
1138,"A NAS is more expensive but it is accessible from other devices and even internet if you wish to (I don't recommend tho). So that really depends on your use case. Make sure your wired/wireless network can sustain the bandwidth of 4K playback.
But I believe that you can't use the DVR functions of the TV if it has no USB storage attached. I haven't checked on mine because it doesn't have an antenna plugged in."

If it continues more than a week then return."

Sometimes under the windows update menu there’s an “optional updates” tab where there’s usually (in my experience) a wifi driver and a Bluetooth driver.

My xm3s connect to my windows 11 but damn does windows take its time to configure them. On windows 10 they connect and audio is instant, now though you gotta give it a minute—with less input / output options too no less.

1171,"If they're connected maybe try updating them in the Sony app and see if that remedies anything.
If not, you probably bought a defective pair and they didn't tell you. It having to be upside down is weird?? Maybe signal interference, have you tried it on any device other than your phone?"
1172,Yea i did. There's no difference sadly. I think they are up to date unless there's a method to downgrade them and try?
1173,I don't know if downgrading is possible unfortunately

1176,"Hey, guys 
So pretty much as said in the title. My earbuds (WFC500) randomly connect to my phone (I use an iPhone, if that matters) despite being inside the case. I’ve noticed that it doesn’t happen if they’re charging (orange lights on). I’ve tried turning off the voice assistant, reseting the bluetooth device and reinstalling the app but it keeps happening. It’s very annoying because I sometimes don’t notice it and when I actually wanna use them they have no charge…
Do you guys know how to fix this?
Sorry if this problem has already been reported, and sorry for my English too (not a native speaker).
Thanks, y’all :)"

1181,"Hi all! I want to buy the Sony HT-A9 for my Philips 55OLED804 TV. I understand this might work due to the fact it is using the HDMI output, so that should be fine. I only have one concern; all promotional material refers to the Bravia setup and the use of a Sony TV as a center speaker. I don't care too much about that.
The only concern I have is that I don't want to use 2 remotes. Is it possible to use the HT-A9 with a non-Sony TV and use CEC to turn up the volume etc? In other words; can I use my Philips remote to turn on the TV and turn up/down the volume of the HT-A9? Thank you!"

1184,"Hi, I'm new to using this camera. I bought it in 2022, and I usually transfer the files to my laptop via the USB cable.  I noticed that for each video that I record, there is always also a picture file (JPG) saved with the initial frame, which for me is not very useful, and it's quite annoying if I have a lot of videos, and I have to delete a lot of these image files. Basically I always have double the number of the files I should have (1 video and its thumbnail). Do you know how can I avoid having all the thumbnails saved?  Is it possible?
Many thanks,
Lorenzo"

1190,Just washed my right earbud of Sony wf-1000xm4 in the washing machine. It was on my pocket and I didn't notice at all. Is there any way I can fix the earbud?

1192,"This is quite unfortunate, I did the same a couple of months ago and luckily they were still in the case. After they came out the wash, the case was dead but somehow the buds lived through it and worked perfectly fine. I ended up buying a genuine replacement case from sony themselves. The issue is I dont know if they would do the same for an entire earbud but you are welcome to try. I also am from the UK so I am not sure if this will work for you. I cannot find the original thread I found my information from or the website I used exactly, but I do have their email if you are interested.  scs@eu.sony.com . Send em an email and see what you can do!"
1193,:( mine were never the same. They did turn on tho. at least you got an excuse to upgrade to the new ones
1194,"I feel that. Did the same thing with my Apple 1st gen airpods. I had the airpods + case in the little pocket on my jeans and it went through a full laundry cycle and then tumble dryed it. My case stopped charging the right channel, and the airpods only held an hour charge at max. 15 minutes if it's below freezing temperatures. :)
Anyway, take the earbuds out of the case and let them sit in room temperature for at least 72h and resist the urge to use them. Do not put them back in the charger case until it's completely dry because that will probably fry the electronics in the earbuds. If the case was in the wash too, don't plug that into a charger either.  You could possibly speed up the process by placing them over a fan exhaust on a PC or whatever and that'll dry them up quicker."

1199,I have an old Sony Bravia KDL-46S2000 that i’m trying to find a TV stand for my dorm because i cannot wall mount it due to me being in a college dorm. I recently just purchased a “universal” TV stand from amazon and it didn’t fit my tv right. I was wondering if anyone would happen to know or could link me to a new one I could purchase that would actually fit. I looked for some original used ones on ebay but they’re all crazy expensive and in horrible condition. Any help is appreciated!

It’s funny how they have a number of products with names like that and then they come out with the linkbuds and linkbuds S.  Either way that punchy startup called Sony will be fine no matter what they call em"

1207,"I have a 3 month old Sony Bravia 55"" A90J, first TV I've ever bought for myself and it was amazing, but my kid whipped a metal toy across the room hitting the panel hard enough to break it. I am finding out now that the panel cannot be replaced so I'm having trouble coming to terms with this amazing device just being garbage now. The rest of the TV components are brand new so I'm looking for advice on what to do with it if anything. Would a TV repair shop want it for spare parts or anything like that? Or is it truly useless at this point. 
Thanks ahead of time for any advice."

1209,"Sorry for your loss. This is kind of expected with young ones.
You could try to sell the TV as is for parts like you mentioned. But the majority of its value is the panel and that alone would cost more to replace than buying a new one. And that is the broken part…. So the value of the rest of the parts is either not much or depending on someone’s need for such parts, which will be banking on luck of the market.
If you bought it from a major retailer like Best Buy you could check with sales staff or geek squad to see what they advise.
If you bought it with a credit card or have home/renter insurance, check with them to see if a claim is either possible or even worth the downside in your case.
Good luck!"
1210,Good idea with the credit card. Ive tried everything else so this will be my last hope. Thanks for tryin to help.

1219,I bought a sony product that was covered under a warranty for defects in the product. After a few months the plastic on the headset broke through normal usage and while preparing the device to be shipped off to be replaced/repaired for warranty purpose a certain somebody decided to break spike the thing on the floor. I had already duct taped the to prevent further damage from being done so it was minor (a bit of plastic popped out) however now I'm afraid sony will void my warranty because of this despite only being minor cosmetic damage.

1238,"hello, I am a streamer on twitch and I plan to use the A7SIII as a camera with the elgato came link, I have several questions.
Can the camera run indefinitely for shows lasting several hours? if not how to cool it? I plan to film in 4k 120/60 fps on twitch is this a good idea?
I absolutely want this camera for youtube and twitch, don't tell me that another one will do, I would also like to know if there is currently a streamer and not a youtuber or someone who does live streams and films with this camera to see the rendering in continuous flow?
I know that the alpha 1 is better but the 8k is useless on rtwitch, neck is it a good choice what additional tools to buy with this camera etc, your advice? your opinions ? your examples?"

1240,"Even 4K is useless on Twitch… before you buy this camera, I implore you to do a lot more research by talking to people in camera shops.  Don’t go to a Best Buy because they’re going to look up the same information using google and they don’t have camera experts anymore.  Why’d you choose the a7S iii?"
1241,"its not streaming in 4K its using elgato and put the camera on "" 4k recording "" without recording the live is actually 1080p but it sbetter to just film in 4k than 1080p that's what i meant by that, A7SIII simply cuz its a good cam i know there is less but i'll use it for ytb as well"

1243,"I ordered these headphones yesterday cause of the overwhelming positive reviews. I didn’t buy the xm5 cause it’s said that the difference isn’t that drastic and I liked the design more of the xm4. Nevertheless they arrived and I tested them and I love them! The sound quality and noice cancelling did life up to my expectations. Only thing that I’m not sure about is that I also bought them cause people said they were really comfortable for long use. After only 15 min I found out that my ear gets irritated in them. I don’t know what to do. My ear literally gets red and it’s burns even after taking them off for half an hour now. It’s such a shame cause I absolutely love the sound and design of them. 
I’m assuming it’s not something that can be helped with a little trick and that it is just how my head/ears are shaped sadly."

My 2 cents. The XM5's are much smaller and lighter so they might be the way to go if that doesnt work out. Nice thing is the tips from comply fit both so your money wouldnt be wasted in trying."

I also discovered I  can no longer access the ""action menu"" to change various display and sound settings. All I get is a grey talk bubble that pops up telling me to ""please wait"".
The TV is not on a timer. I checked that already
I did a reset from the settings menu on the home page but this does not seem  to have corrected the problem.
I have never connected this TV to the internet or anything. It's firmware is still from 2017"

1285,"My mother has gone off to America and will be staying there for a bit more. Now i own a pair of WH-1000XM3s (coming up on 5 years old this summer), which are starting to show their wear and tear. I have the chance to get the WF-XM5s as a present, as she's told me that she will buy something for me from there as a present (and i can choose what, as long as they don't exceed 350€).
Now, I'm very much interested in the XM5s, since i'm interested in a pair of true wireless buds for going shorter distances by public transport, walks and potential as a pair of workout buds as well. They've also got the same ANC tech as the WH-XM series,.which is fantastic. They're also about 50€ cheaper in the US compared to my home country.
I will keep my WH-XM3s, though, but they're a massive inconvenience to put in your pocket once you're done with them. I should add that the only true wireless experience I've had is with the rather terrine Galaxy Buds Live, and i want to replace them.
What do you recommend? Should i buy the XM5s or not?
Edit; I'm referring to these XM5s"

1287,"i got em like 2 weeks ago, best in ears ive ever had. it fits better air pods pro, have better sound and anc. if id crash em today, id buy em again tomorrow"
1288,"Really? Some people have buyers remorse, others are saying they're good. The ANC isn't good, according to some (something i put pretty heavy emphasis on because i often go on buses that are pretty loud). It's really tough because i can't just return them (they're coming from the US) and get the money back. And i have to decide by Friday."
1289,I got buyer's remorse.
1290,"How so? I was considering the Sennheiser Momentum 4's as well, to straight up replace my XM3s."
1291,"I have buyers remorse too. 
It’s definitely no better than any midrange Bluetooth earbuds, and worse than a midrange one with a cable. Sony advertises it mainly for the ANC function but that is just too weak, won’t drown out the subway or anything really. It relies more on passive noise cancellation than active. If that’s what you’re after you’ll be disappointed.
It’s good for listening to music that’s not too demanding, making calls, and it’s very comfortable to wear for hours, but don’t buy it for the ANC.
Basically it’s no better than the competition therefore way overpriced. The ANC is a gimmick."
1292,"Gotcha. I might just get the over-ear Momentum 4s to replace my aging XM3s then. I was looking into Bose as well, but considering there's almost always a yearly or bi-yearly update, I'm not so sure.
I'm mostly looking to downsize for shorter usage times, as my XM3 are still going. It's just annoying to carry a big pair of over-ears everywhere though.
I have seen the AirPods Pro 2 for sale for 200£. Might just get those instead, but the lack of sound profile customization is a bother for me."
1293,"100% agreed. Additionally the anti wind mode is gone, and the product just feels cheap"
1294,"Still have the XM4's and since 2 weeks the XM5's. They are very similar, but the XM5's add a couple of quality of life features, such as better fit and a tad better audio."
1295,"Yeah. I'm much of a 'get the new shiny thing and keep it for 3 years' kind of guy. Same mentality when i bought my S23 Ultra (best phone I've ever had, even 6 months later).
The XM4s are good, no doubt. I did buy my WH-XM3s roughly a year after their release. But since they're so new, and my other wireless earbuds (Buds Live) are honestly kinda crap, I'm leaning towards the XM5s right now.
It's a gift from my mom, after all. She's just told me to state the request (it's within her gift budget for me as well)"
1296,"They are amazing, especially with LDAC and a good music streaming service or FLAC's."
1297,"Oh for sure. My superb experience with my overear XM3s tell me that Sony's buds are very good as well. But I'm on the edge between the WF-XM4s, the XM5s, or just replacing my current WH-XM3s with a pair of Sennheiser Momentum 4s (discounted to roughly 300$ on Best Buy rn)."
1298,"If you like the Sony's, you'd better go with the XM5's. Audio quality isn't much different with the XM4's, but fit much, much better. I'm not familiar with Adaptive aptx and how they compare to LDAC."
1299,"I listen via M4A anyway, so that isn't much of an issue. I'm probably gonna think over it and decide tomorrow. I would've gotten the WH-XM5s if they weren't sitting at their original price tag."
1300,"I bought mine last week, kinda regret it, they are quite uncomfortable"
1301,Have you tried switching up the size of the ear pieces?
1302,"Yes. The smaller ones are too small to make an air seal, making ANC non existing"
1303,I would recommend Comply's tips for the earphones. Heard they're very good and much more comfortable.
1304,[deleted]
1305,"I see. I was referring to the WF-1000XM5, but it's good to know the big ones possess some flaws too."
1306,"If it’s between the XM4’s and XM5’s get the 5’s. I don’t know anyone so far that feels that the 4’s were more comfortable than the 5’s.  Not saying the 4’s won’t be comfortable in your ears, just why risk that. 
​
As many earbuds that I have used in the past, I’ve never tried the sennheisers but have heard a lot of good abou them."
1307,"I can fold the xm4 4 cups when it's on the neck and that's a deal breaker for me with the xm5s. Other than that, xm5 is a good successor."
1308,They're talking about the earbuds.
1309,My bad.
1310,No don't buy them.  The sound is great and ANC pretty good but I prefer my galaxy buds pro 2 and j just got beats studio plus to replace them.. Sony messed up on the battery and I would not purchase especially if out of the US..
1311,"I'm getting then purchased by my mother within the US. They sit at 300£, which is perfect for my price point. What else would you recommend though?"
1312,Beats studio buds + (I have a pair arriving tomorrow) but I'm sour on Sony because of the issues with the 4s
1313,"I'll be honest I enjoyed my xm4s and I also have both the wh-1000xm4 & 5s but the build quality of the Sony case mixed with the poor battery, build quality of the buds and lack of repair options, and poor customer service from Sony really made me search for other options. I love my girlfriend airpods which felt much nicer (very very slightly less sound quality but better ANC) so I'm going for the beats studio buds +"
1314,"Would it be worth it to get the AirPods Pro 2nd Gen as an Android user though? I'm looking to downsize for shorter distances and potentially have a pair of workout buds. I kinda want to go for the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, but still unsure. the WF-XM5s are the newest on the market and since they get bi-yearly updates, i want to use these alongside my WH1000XM3s for at least 4 years."
1315,The galaxy buds pro 2 are great but they are a little wiggly in my ear and the wind cancelling isn't as good as the Sony's. I got some comply foam eartips that have helped. The reason I went for the beats studio buds + is because I heard they are basically airpods for Android and they are clear.  I wouldn't get the airpods as an android user just because I like to be able to customize my sound and I don't think you can do much with airpods on Android
1316,"I see. The reviews are mixed (Reddit at least, the headphones havr a collective 4☆ rating on the stores' sites) and since i can't return it is why I'm anxious and scrambling to research as much as i can. Had i been able to return them, i could just cherry pick into what buds i want.
My main fear is the comfort of the tips, ANC (hoping it's on par w/ my WH-1000XM3s) and sound quality. The mic isn't much of an issue because i rarely get phone calls in inherently busy environments. Plus if I'm going longer distances, I'm picking my over-ears."
1317,wtf airpods have better ANC than sony wf100xm5? you are kidding me
1318,"Airpod pros have better ANC than Sony wf-1000XM4s (in ear buds), it's cIose though, haven't tried the 5s yet.  Also airpod pros have better transparency mode as well.  I miss being able to dial in the ANC with the Sony app and I can confirm the beats studio buds plus only fit better than the Sony wf-1000xm4s.  So far the Sony XM4s have the best sound quality of in ear buds."
1319,I think you probably made a good choice.  If your ears are normal size and I'm assuming they worked out the battery issues then you're going to be very happy!
1320,"I haven't exactly placed the order yet. I don't really know if ears are normally, since one ear canal is narrower than the other. I'm also considering the AirPods Pro (2nd Gen), as pretty much everybody in my family has an Apple device and they're at 199$. Or the Sennheiser Momentum TWS 3 at 179$ But I'm gonna call her up and make my mind up today at the most."
1321,We found out with the wfXM4s that if you could fit a quarter in your concha (the open area outside of your ear canal)  that the xm4s would work.  If too small the airpods were a better choice. We got my gf the airpod pros with extra small comply tips and they are perfect for her.  Hopefully that helps with your decision
1322,"I see. Are the tips similarly sized to headphones included in with a Samsung phone? Those eartips are my reference points, and the small size fits my ears well. The material is also nice and snug."
1323,Yeah I'd say so I was using the mediums from Samsung and ordered the medium comply tips they fit better and even hold the buds in my ears better.  We got them for my GF for that exact reason the airpods would fall out of her ears and with the comply tips she can wear them for running.
1324,"That's nice. All though me getting them is now uncertain. My mother didn't find them in Walmart, and i urged her to go to Best Buy. It's gonna cost a good 60-70$ more if she can't find them by tomorrow before she flies back.
I'm not gonna buy them from here, I'm saving for the WH1000XM6 at that point. Still, good to know that the eartips will fit me well. I have AKG tips from my included headphones as well. They might not have the mesh, but i usually clean them up after every use anyway."
1325,Especially if your ears aren't large
1326,"How are you able to maintain WF 1000xm3 for 5 years? My sister had a pair, the left buds wasn't working with the bluetooth. And when we go to Sony Centre, we need to pay the same amount as how new earbuds costs.
My step father also got a pair, the battery on both earbuds were always finish too fast. Sony Centre still asking for a fee as how new earbuds costs. Just to change a freaking battery? I just can't believe it.
I suggest to my step father to choose WF-1000XM4 or XM5 because probably Sony address various issues on previous product, XM3s."
1327,"They weren't WF1000XM3, they're the WH1000XM3, the over-ear ones. I've daily driven them and they keep on going. But they're starting to fall behind after 4 years of near daily usage."
1328,My bad i read it wrong.
1329,"I have the WF1000-XM3 and it's still working fine.
Just bought the XM5 and... It's just smaller.
The sound is the same (a bit louder, tbh), more difficult to remove from the case due to that shine finishing, less comfortable due to that foam ear tip and the ANC is basic the same."

1336,"To make a long story short.. I've had this tv for 3 years now, and I've never had any issues when running any steaming apps before...until recently, the last 8 months-1yr.. whether it's Netflix, Paramount, or Crave...anytime this TV is turned on, after being put in to sleep mode (which for some god unknown reason, I'm not able to fully shut down..) every app, and any movement whatsoever, is incredibly laggy, and 80% of the time, the apps crash, sound doesn't work, or it takes 3-4 clicks of a button for the TV to respond. I've done a factory reset several times thinking it would help, but as of recent I've found out that this only happens due to the TV being put to sleep. Anytime I turn the tv on and it starts to act up instantaneously, I hold the power button down, restart the tv and boom, works perfectly.. I've checked every damn setting and there is no ability to change the power setting to ensure everytime I power down the tv, it actually shuts down instead of going to sleep. 
Has any one else experienced this? I'm reaching a point where I'm thinking of never purchasing another Sony tv again, which sucks, because I love the cinematic picture (vs Samsungs being overly saturated and exaggerated imo)."

1344,"Hi, just got my xm4 headphones today and I have to say I love them but Im having 1 issue with them on PC. So the headphones are connected through 3.5mm jack to the PC motherboard (Asus ROG STRIX B760-A GAMING WIFI) and the sound is so bad and I can't really fix it. I love using them through bluetooth on my phone but I'd also like to use my new headphones on PC without any problems. :("

1346,These headphones are not meant to be used wired. Make sure that they're on while you are using them wired. But these are the wrong headphones for a 3.5 mm jack setup and also way more expensive. You could buy a better pair of headphones for cheaper if that was what you wanted them for
1347,Wired and turned off you need to heavily EQ then to sound like the standard DSP when turned on. Otherwise turn them on also when plugged in. This fixes it the easy way.
1348,"One thing is just plugging them in ( which sound better than BT even LDAC) but if you want even better sound turn on MX4 AND plug in they sound better hands down cause now the headphones use ANC as well with the wired connection. Much louder too without washing out with distortion. 
I would also like to add for those wanting to use BT only (not wired) . Make sure that 1st and formost, on the Sony app. you don't have (Connect to 2 devices simultaneously) this is found on headphones / SYSTEM on Sony App. If this is selected you will never see the LDAC option on your Androids bluetooth configuration for the device. 
go to your phones bluetooth . scroll down to connected devices. in this case you wh-100XMA. there will be a little gear next to it. Select that you will see use this device for calls, audio and LDAC . select that.  
if you dont have the LDAC anything else you do whether it be under developer options with Bluetooth frequencies, codecs, etc. Will revert back. I see people going crazy over this why it doesn't stay. That's the reason..
I learned this the hard way a while back when I had some other Sony's and I couldn't figure it out. I just ended up returning them.
These headphones are pretty good. I have tried them against the BOSE QC 45, other lower-end Sinnheiser 568BT, JBL etc. and the sound quality is pretty good. even better with FLAC files. they just need to be configured correctly. There are just way too many chefs in the kitchen trying to control the digital processing and sometimes they fight against each other. 
I have found its best to leave all the EQ flat. the Android one, the Sony as well and in my case I use the Android app PowerAMP (which has a slider on the left of the equalizer called preamp that will even give you a little boost in increase in volume.
​
<image>"
1349,"IF you dont see the LDAC when you go to configuration of connected BT devices on under Android then nothing on WI-FI connection only will sound poor.  For wired only you wont even be connected just make sure headphones are on for best sound - and nothing compares to the wire connection. its louder, clearer, and truly shines.
<image>"
1350,"Here is a picture of the Android app - PowerAMP.  If you look all the way to the left next to the EQ it says preamp. You can get a little more volume boost if they are not loud enough for you.  Use sparingly cause too much will distort.  It's free territory above volume restriction edge so you can only squeeze a little more.

1388,"So I bought the WH-1000XM4 in January and while I love everything about these headphones, they are slowly but surely making me crazy because of all the notifications that can’t be turned off. I already had sensitive ears and I feel like this is getting worse because of these daily notifications. They are too loud for me. 
I have read many posts from years ago and it seems like Sony will never update this and allow us to turn off the notifications (« Bluetooth 1 connected.. », etc…) 
Unfortunately I didn’t see these posts before buying them. I am writing today to know if the XM5 have the same problem as I am considering getting them. Or if you have any other recommendations of headphones with the option to turn off notifications/notifications with a very low volume/notifications that don’t overrun what I am listening to. Good noise canceling is extremely important and I really like the sound with the XM4. 
Thank you for the help"

1392,"What type of notifications are you referring to, like emails and texts received, or are you talking about Sony Headphone app notifications? If it's the app notifications, then why don't you just turn off notifications for the app?"
1393,"I am referring to the following notifications « Bluetooth device 1/2 connected/disconnected » and « Bluetooth connected/disconnected ». Even if I stay within range of my phone or laptop my devices will eventually disconnect and reconnect immediately. These  notifications are loud, frequent (~15-20 times a day) and will overrun anything that I was listening to. 
Edit : I have already turned off the notifications and vocal guide through the app but this is not helping with these notifications"
1394,"Never experienced what you describe here.
Got them about a year ago, but never had a disconnect.
I get a notification when turning them on and when turning them off.
But I only use them within a range of about 8 meters max.  
Maybe there's another signal or device blocking yours?
Do you leave the 10m range?
Can you try it someplace without other devices in the range?"
1395,It will happen even if I am in the same room. I will just randomly disconnect and reconnect automatically. I wouldn’t dream about even going 8 meters away from the connected device…
1396,I've only got my headphones so can't guide you to where you need to go. But I remember seeing a setting about high quality sound and you can turn that off if the headphones constantly disconnect. Edit found it. Priotize stable sound
1397,"Oh thank you ! Just turned on « prioritize stable sound », I will try that out for today and let you know if it works."
1398,Good luck :)
1399,Unfortunately it didn’t help much.. I am going to ask for headphones recommendations on another sub and buy a new pair. Thank you for helping tho :)
1400,"The XM5s only have a ""ding"" ringtone without voices so it may suite you better."
1401,Thank you for confirming that ! I think I am going to get them instead. Would you say the « ding » is loud ? Is it overrunning the sound that is played at the same time ?

1411,"i personally dislike the WH's out of the box EQ style, too dark and muddy. It's also not foldable so not as travel friendly as others. ANC is a hit and miss sometimes since Sony's put their ""Auto"" mode in it. Sometimes it sucks, sometimes it's fine. if you can get it for cheaper then yes, otherwise, no."

1414,"So recently I bought a pair of Sony IER-M9's (they were on sale) and waited while FedEx was taking an extremely long time bringing me said headphones. I started wearing them and really liked them (though not as much as I thought I would) and realized something as I was holding them today. They are M7's. For context, the M9 is $1600 full price and was $1000 on sale. The M7's are $800 full price and $500 on sale, literally half the price. It's hard to even know how this happened because the M7's are labelled IER-M7 right on the goddamn earbud and the M9's are presumably labelled M9. Also Sony's customer support hours on their website are just fucking wrong? Sony says they're regular hours are 7-7 but trying to call reveals they're 10-10. I've been a Sony person for audio for a long time now, I was even considering getting a Sony phone, recent fuck-ups like this one are making me upset and considering looking at other brands for headphones in the future."

I asked for an update today and they replied that due to system maintenance my case has not been been reviewed this entire week. I was going to ask for replacement headphones, now I'm going to ask for a refund and I'm never buying from Sony again. What awful customer service for such a big mistake."

When I take out one earbud to take a little break the ambient sound turn on fully (ambient sound 20) and that´s super annoying to me and actually hurt my ears because it´s to loud for me and I still want the noise canceling to be on. I want the ambient sound to be automaticly off forever without me having to do it manually every time I take out one earbud. Pls help, thanks."

1438,So I’m planning on buying a new pair of headset for my daily and gaming use. I mainly game on PS5. Money is not an issue and I can spend a couple more bucks for a bluetooth dongle for the PS5 if necessary. I know that you can use ANC on XM5 while its plugged into the DualSense by using power. I mainly play single player games and I don’t play any major multiplayer games at all(I play mostly PvE ones if I’m playing multiplayer). I want to know which one is better in terms of ANC and audio quality and for daily use. Thanks in advance.

1440,"you are better off with the inzone device as the latency will be much much lower with the inzone usb dongle than the wh-1000xm5 and a usb dongle.
when I mean lower latency, I am referring to sub 30ms for the inzone. I would expect much higher with the wh-1000xm5 and dongle."
1441,"I see. But latency becomes a problem only if I’m gonna play competitive multiplayer, which I’m not. And if the audio quality is the same when I power it on and plug it in to the DualSense then I don’t mind that way as well."
1442,Latency is also a problem with regular video games because you'll get disjointed dialogue and awkward combat sounds
1443,"you wrote multiplayer, so I assumed it was competitive. Again the wh-1000xm5 and dongle could be around 200-250 ms latency. this is the nature of bluetooth tech on the wh-1000xm5 currently. No idea if the playstation5 has any delays it puts on to sync the audio, my guess it does not.
the wh-1000xm5 have been certified for LE audio which will be much lower latency but no firmware update has been released yet like the linkbuds s."
1444,Oh ok. Let’s say I use the xm5s while I plug them in to the dualsense controller and use them in wired mode and with the power on. Will I be able to get the same/better audio quality than the h9s? I don’t have a particular preference that I have to use it wirelessly.
1445,"I don't own the inzone h9, just the wh-1000xm5. From reviews the inzone's have ok NC if you want to use it, but the wh-1000xm5 will be better. also do you use the mic often when gaming?"
1446,Umm I don’t use the mic at all lol😅
1447,then get the wh-1000xm5.

1470,I dropped my left earbud into a (thankfully) clean toilet. It wasn't in the water for any more than 3-4 seconds and I promptly dried and then cleaned it after getting it out. It still sounds normal on all settings so far (I'm posting this about 7 hours after this happened and I have been using them during those 7 hours as well) should I be worried or does it seem like I'm in the all clear?

1476,"I had the MX4s for about a year, and they were pretty solid, but broke on the swivel. I was bummed to look this up online and find out that it's a widely discussed problem.
Do the MX5s fix this problem or is it largely the same? They got rid of the folding, which is why the hinges were needed, right? Or am I misunderstanding the build?
I don't care THAT much about a possibly weaker ANC (honestly sometimes it felt like the MX4 ANC was hurting my ears in a weird way). I just don't want to drop $400 on a new set only for it to break again in a year."

1479,"They recently started broadcasting atsc 3.0 near me. I think all the main .1s are broadcasting on one rf channel as atsc 3.0.
The guide gets a bit confused with .1s available via atsc 3.0 & atsc 1.0 broadcasts.
Is there anyway to see technical details about how the channel is tuned? (Rf channel #, atsc version, etc?)  Via the tv?
I can see some video/audio details with the display button.  
Takes forever to change channels. Did see a channel in 1080p hdr broadcast though which was interesting.
Then i lost the signal, unsure if local rf interference or what."

1498,"I'm wondering if bluetooth is completely turned off when I use my WH-1000XM3 with cable. And if therefore also no radiation is emitted.
I noticed that when the headphone is switched on and the cable is plugged (as oppose to when the cable is not plugged) the headphones don't show up on my smartphone when I scan for bluetooth devices.
Does that mean that there is no (bluetooth) radiation? Or is it possible that the signal is merely encoded so that the phone doesn't recognize it?
Someone mentioned that it was not possible to switch off bluetooth on the XM2's.
Did Sony change that and now the bluetooth is off with the cable plugged or am I missing something?
Thank You so much in advance"

I turned off the auto shut down function, i tried reseting the headphone, but it keeps doing it. When i unlock my phone it connects automatically again but after another 5 minutes it disconnects again. It can't be that my phone is too far away from the headphone because it was a meter away from me.
What should I try? Any ideas from anyone?

I've tried a bunch of memory foam tips, including Comply truegrip, and can't get a seal with anything sized L. I've got Spinfit 360s that seal but I'd prefer foam for the isolation and comfort.

But sometimes while moving and listening to music (spotify) one of the earbuds cuts out for less than a second, it happens enough that i'm irritated by it. I suspect a connection issue because it's mostly while moving, it happens most to my left earbud but sometimes to my right one (I keep my phone in my right pocket, so maybe the connection to the left earbud isn't strong enough). Is this a known issue? Any tips or should I just get a new pair? Thanks if anyone can help me with this problem."

It acts like there are no cards inserted, and I have no status lights on the side. I feel like this is generally only a problem during summer months with the heat. I don’t seem to have this problem during the winter. Is there a known heat problem with this model of camera? Is anyone else had this issue and a found a solution? Usually setting the camera in the air conditioning anywhere from 5-60 minutes does the trick to get it working again."

1561,"Hello everyone,
Does anyone know of a remote repeater that will work with the Sony RMF-TX800U and my Rogers Ignite TV Box? The box is in a cabinet so I require a repeater. The Sony remote is hit and miss with the Rogers Box to start. It works for the first few days by pushing the ""123"" button and selecting the on screen controls for the Rogers Ignite box and then stops working a few days later. Hoping a repeater helps with operating Rogers box in the cabinet. The consistent functionality of the Sony remote and the Rogers box is another issue I'm still looking for a solution. 
Thanks in advance!"

1564,"Hi everyone, yesterday I finally pulled the trigger and decided to buy the new WF-1000xm5 earbuds, upgrading from my previous Samsung galaxy buds+. 
So I watched a bunch of reviews and got really hyped up because this would be one of the best earbud models out there with killer ANC.
After putting them in for the first time, the music sounds great and with some equalizer changes its great.
However ANC wise, I can still hear everything around me like voices, the television and slow driving cars. I fiddled around with the app (like installing all updates, reconnecting, etc) and I ran the eartips size test, which led me to wear the Large eartips. This experience was already different because my previous earbuds had these wingtips which secured them extra in place.
After testing a bunch I just notice that there is no difference between me having noise cancelling enabled and just having the earbuds off.
This results makes me incredibly disappointed since the ANC was the biggest factor for me to buy this pair.
So I was just wondering if anyone else is experiencing this issue and if I am just expecting too much or if I should get the buds checked out for a broken chip?
PS. I even tried using the silicon tips of my previous earbuds."

1566,The difference between having the earbuds off and having them on with ANC on is very drastic. Something is definitely wrong either with your settings or with your set being faulty
1567,"I tried factory resetting the buds, however that doesn't seem to make a difference.
I also made family members try them out and they say they can hear a very minor difference between ANC on and off.
Something interesting to notice is that before the reset it said it was using LDAC, but after the reset that option isn't available anymore"
1568,Are you sure you are comparing OFF and NAC.. and NOT ambient sound and ANC?? To me the ANC is very very poor.
1569,Not sure if you maybe have some settings changed but almost every review is saying they have the best or equal best ANC on the market. So I don't think your set or settings are right if you think yours are very poor
1570,I ran some online tests and people are reporting the same. The ANC blocks only low end sounds where dor instance Airpods block high frequencies as well.
1571,Hmmm this definitely doesn't align with my experience or the reviews Ive seen from major tech reviewers
1572,"Yes, the tech reviews are saying completely different."
1573,The biggest changer for me was trying all the ear tips sizes and use a bigger one (XS -> Medium). The WF-1000xm5 relies a lot more on passive noise-cancelling than active noise-cancelling.
1574,"As mentioned, I am currently using the large ones. 
I did indeed try all of them including the test, and having anything smaller makes it even worse."
1575,"I agree. ANC is doing almost nothing, but the passive isolation is good."
1576,"I've been having this exact same issue. I've been trying all kinds of tips, both foam and silicone, to find a setup that works for me and nothing quite right yet. The best I've gotten is XL spinfit 360s but they're not amazing for ANC.
Pretty disappointed so far but we might just have awkward ear canals  we need to find the right ear tips for. The seal seems to be everything.
If anyone has found a solution or some tip recommendations for ears where the Ls are slightly too small, I'd love to hear it.!"
1577,"I tried a different pair at the store today, they gave me the same results. I decided to return them.
Sadly I don't think its me, I had multiple family members test them and we all had similar results."
1578,I felt the same way when I first got my 1000 XM 5S but then someone commented that really they're not designed to drown out background conversation or television to design to to eliminate noise such a fan of air conditioners which mine do a great job an airplane noise
1579,"Yeah I can understand that, however that isn't specified anywhere and I want it to block out more dynamic noise"
1580,"To me the ANC change is very drastic, like I can’t hear anything with ANC on"
1581,"Even with no music playing, in a semi busy area? You don't hear other people talking?
Reading mixed reviews from others."
1582,"With no music I can hear yeah like they do cancel but you can still hear a little, but for example when i got them I tried playing music while having a YouTube video on mi tv ( was some tech review video with 2 persons speaking ) and even with the music volume at like 20% i couldn’t hear anything even with the tv sound double the loud I usually watch, but what I hate is they are very uncomfortable and they fall off often which reduces the noise canceling a lot, so while they are well fit in the ear the ANC is awesome, but as soon as they slide a little the noise canceling isn’t as good, i tried all the eartips in the box and still the same, the Airpods Pro have a way more comfortable fit to me, specially in bed. But the noise canceling is way better on the Sonys to me."
1583,"Not to sound rude but are you wearing them properly?
You may need to pinch the foam with your finger tips and then secure it firmly in your ear. Once the foam expands they stay snug even when you're sweating."
1584,"I have tried it with all the tips till L cause L and bigger won’t fit in my ears, and yeah i do as you say and they still fall quite easily"
1585,"Are you sure you are not comparing ANC and AMBIENT SOUND? Then the difference is drastic, but the difference between ANC and OFF is minimal.."
1586,Anc works great on my set but this thread just reminded me that I have some comply foam tips from my XM4's that I will try to put on.
1587,So them tips from the XM4 fit on the xm5?
1588,"yes just confirmed and dare I say, they feel even lighter!"
1589,Reason I’ve gone back to over ear for gym as nothing more annoying than listening to music but with gym music and members talking in background
1590,"Yeah that makes sense, I currently own the wh1000xm3 and I would switch to wh1000xm5 if they were foldable."
1591,"Hold up… I have the 4’s. They fold, did they just fully take that away with the 5? Do they not have a storage case?"
1592,"They do not fold, they do have a storage case, but is obviously way bigger."
1593,"Hmmm now I have mixed feelings. I though for sure with the thinner hinges it would still fold. 
Thank you! Happy to have the 4’s!"
1594,"There’s a certain way to insert these earbuds that for me at least, makes a big difference. If you push them in vertical and then rotate them 90 degrees towards the back of your ear then they almost lock into place. Often if my sound quality doesn’t seem right or there is outside noise bleeding in then this is the first thing I check.
I’ve found the ANC to be really good, I work as a machine operator and they cut out the noise by at least 80% the difference for me is night and day."
1595,"I tried a different pair at the store today, they gave me the same results. I decided to return them.
I'm surprised the noise cancelling work so wel for you"
1596,You should get the bose qc2 I have the sonys and the difference is night and day plus the bose sound better and a lot more bass if you want it
1597,"I saw someone else mentioning them as well, however looking at This is Tech Today review I notice that the wf5 are doing better at ANC than the bose qc 2. Also I think that the bose qc2 sounds the worse out of these 4."
1598,Those factory ear tips suck. I had to change out to get a good seal
1599,I'd like to know what you switched to too
1600,Yeah they're terrible. I switched to comply foam like I have with every pair of WF earbuds and the ANC is fantastic
1601,What did you switch them out to?
1602,"comply are great, using them. factory ones are crap and hurt my ear
edit: comma"
1603,can confirm stock tips are garbage.
1604,"You are correct that the ANC is poor. I tried comply tips and while they are a little more comfortable, they don't help much."
1605,"That is a shame, I see mixed reviews"
1606,ANC works best on low frequency (~1000Hz). Do you notice a big difference with AC/exhaust fans? If so then it’s working.
1607,"I tried it with a second pair and yes that worked. However it wasn't specified that it only noise cancels consistent noises.
I was expecting it to cancel less predictable noise like voices"
1608,"Did you check on the settings in the app. There is something like adaptive anc, which sometimes plays back the sound of the environment instead of canceling it out."
1609,"Yeah, I totally disabled that"
1610,"Just to confirm you went to the app and clicked ""noise cancelling"" right? Under the ""sound"" tab.
Because for me the anc is BETTER than any anc earbuds out there and I've tried MANY brands. Airpods being the closest one. And from one of ur other replies, obviously in a crowded busy area you will start to hear conversations, trains buses etc. I don't think there's any anc headphones or earbuds that can block absolutely 100% of sounds
Also I pretty much don't use the foam tips at all. I use large silicone tips, they form a better seal imo.
Although I won't lie, I xm4's noise cancelling is MUCH better, they're larger after all. I currently have 1 xm4 and xm5 bud on each ear. And the xm4 blocks a lot more. And to be more honest, I think you should get the xm4, better anc, better volume control, better ambient sounds (xm5's ambient is not as loud), and xm4 has slightly better sound quality"
1611,"I tried different tips, including silicon ones with ofcourse noise cancelling (or noise suppression) and I could hear a minor difference with the second pair that I tried, however at home I could still hear my family even when I know they were talking very quietly.
Some other replies mention that it is supposed to noise canceling lower frequencies, like the AC and fans. However no-one ever mentioned in a review that you could only use it for that and not more dynamic and unpredictable high frequency noises like voices and other devices."
1612,"Are the WF-Xm5's ANC slightly or much better than AirPods Pro 2? I currently have WF-XM4s and AirPods Pro 2, so deciding to buy WF-XM5's takes some convincing. My gripe with the AirPods Pro 2 is the ANC seems to be no good for leaking all the mids and treble into my ears."
1613,"Well, again I honestly believe the XM4s are better than the XM5, One feature on the XM5s that really kill it for me is the new volume function, it's no longer controlled by one side.
So on the Sony app there's only 3 function options, ambient, playback or neither. If you select neither you cannot control the volume at all, so you're forced to either use ambient or playback.
TO decrease volume you have to REPEATEDLY tap the left earbud, to increase you have to Repeatedly tap the left earbud. So I'm always accidentally turning on/off the ambient or anc setting because again I'm forced to have it on like I mentioned in the middle paragraph. 
If I remember correctly however when the airpod pros 2 released I did try it out against my xm4, I tested them out for hours and it's hard to notice but, surprisingly sound quality is very similar BUT the airpod pros 2 at max volume was not as loud as the xm4s at max volume, which killed the deal for me I'm picky about stuff. 
So all in all, I think the XM4s are better than both, better anc, better ambient sounds. Slightly better quality than the XM5s, and WAYYY better volume control"
1614,I would honestly go with the airpods pro 2 if I wasn't an android user. I had the original airpods and the issue I had with those was compatible and alot of ambient noise.
1615,"Yes good point, if ur an iPhone user, airpods should be the go to. I'm an android user I have an android tablet and phone, so I use the sony's"
1616,"I have the same problem as OP! I made a post about it over week ago. There's some good discussion there!  
https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyHeadphones/comments/15m7ksr/wf1000xm5_anc/"
1617,"If you want the best noise cancelling, buy Bose QC ii."
1618,"I saw someone else mentioning them as well, however looking at This is Tech Today review I notice that the wf5 are doing better than the bose qc 2."
1619,"I had Bose QC ii earbuds and wf-1000XM4. Bose's noise canceling is not comparable to XM4s. They are in another league. I think they should be compared to headphones. The reason is probably the sealing method which is different from Sony's. Sony uses foam heads. They are not effective and comfortable. On the other hand, Bose uses stability bands. For my ears, Bose weas much better in sealing and comfortability."
1620,"I’d say defective but your tried a different pair. Hearing  all these negatives when I can sit in the same small living room with my family, they watch tv loud. Switch to noise cancelling and can’t hear a thing. Same in my garage. Ambient I can hear the mini-split(fan speed on high)/noise canceling not even a whisper. It’s like the world stopped. That’s with the stock ear tips. My wife try’s to have a conversation with me and it’s like she’s not even there. They’re a 10/10 for me. I have good hearing too. 70db is too loud for me."
1621,That is really weird because going back to this review This is Tech Today review even when they do the noise cancelling test with a voice you can still hear it. So I have no idea how it cancels so well for you
1622,"I’ll check it out. I had mediums in originally that passed the app test but noticed my right ear felt loose. I tested it with my extremely loud bathroom exhaust fan from ‘96. I could hear it in my right by not my left. I switched to a large in my right ear and it was like someone turned it off. I think the seal is the key. I’d try aftermarket tips like some users suggested. My experience is awesome and also on phone calls, the mic is incredible."
1623,Did you do the firmware update? There was one that had to be done right out the gate.
1624,Yeah did that
1625,"The ANC is great, you just need to find tips that give you a good seal. Sometimes I turn the ANC off and on again to remind myself how much the buds are doing."
1626,So your ANC works great with no music on and voices in the background?
1627,"Yes. (But to be clear, you can always hear something...some version of something. That's not a knock. I've never had ANC on any device ever that you couldn't hear absolutely anything (the closest to that is the WH-1000xm5 - creepy quite, in a good way.). I'm very happy with the ANC on the WF-1000xm5's. I nap with with them on (no music) and sleep with them, too). If you have music etc playing, of course, they're even better."
1628,"Well in my case, I was in a quiet room and I could still hear my brother softly talking towards our dog.
So no they weren't great for me"
1629,Sorry. Hopefully you can find what you're looking for.
1630,No sadly I decided to return them after trying a second pair with the same results
1631,"Mine does not really work at all... I made a post about it as well, and there are many saying the same. Are you sure you are not comparing ambient sound and anc?  
https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyHeadphones/comments/15m7ksr/wf1000xm5_anc/"

I turned off any setting that might have caused it, but nothing works. They worked perfectly fine before, so I don’t know what caused it. Any idea how to fix it?"

1654,"I was just chilling out and playing an online game with my friend where all of a sudden the noise cancelling on my xm5s felt 'less', like i could hear myself talking more and my surroundings, I got a bit worried since ive only had this for like a week and dont want to have somehow broken it already, when I go to the sony headphones app there doesnt seem to be much of a difference between NC and off, so im getting worried is my xm5 properly broken or have i done something wrong?"

1658,"Don’t connect them wireless to your device, I have the xm4’s fixed all issues when I plugged them in"
1659,Whats the point of it being wireless then...
1660,"Check the Sony Headphones app and confirm that ""Ambient Sound Mode"" is set to noise cancelling. I've had it switch to ambient sound mode on its own before. While you're at it, you could turn off speak to chat, that also triggers a period of worse cancelling that I don't enjoy."
1661,"yeah ive fiddled around the headphones app trying to sort this issue, like i said nc and the off button practically are giving me the same outcome in terms of 'noise cancelling', one big thing that im using to differ what I was experiencing yesterday vs whats going on now is how clear i can hear my own voice when im talking, the other day it was very muffled to show that the noise cancelling was working, now its like im wearing every other headphones which practically removes their selling point of the 'best noise cancelling headphones' out there"
1662,"Same thing here. When I first got the XM5s they were magical with noise cancelation. Now they're not much better than the noise cancelation on my Samsung beans (which aren't even in-ear). A good test was the bathroom fan. While there is definitely noise cancelling occurring, it is still clearly audible. When I first got the headphones, the bathroom fan was basically silent when ANC was on. All I can think is that the software (firmware?) update changed something. 
Just talked to their support and they said you can't roll back headphone software versions. So I have to exchange them."
1663,"that really sucks, there’s probably somewhere on the internet way to force old
firmware back in but i’m too lazy to do research and don’t want to destroy these headphones, what’s worse is they literally have the potential to be so good and for some reason sony just doesn’t want it to happen?"

1676,"Have you tried adjusting the EQ? They do sound quite muffled out the box because they are set to either manual or some generic EQ setting. Try downloading the Sony Headphones connect app, and using the beta EQ tool under the “sound” menu made a pretty substantial difference with sound quality once they were tuned a bit more. Best of luck, and also make sure you have the best foam tips you can get silicon eartips I find distort the sound quite a bit on the Sonys"

1689,"Hey all, was curious as to what to buy linkbud s or the new xm5s. I am an apple user and I plan on taking these to the gym and just using them as daily drivers. I already have AirPods so I want to try a pair of Sonys. What do y’all think? Thanks in advance!"

1691,"Link buds S!
Hear me out.
The link buds S are in my honest opinion so close in both playback quality and features. Not to mention the price is half the new WF-XM5.
Here are the pros for Link buds S:
Smaller and lighter: The buds fit perfectly snug and doesn't apply pressure on the ears. This is a crucial if you plan on using them for Hours.
Audio quality is basically the same: I have both products and I can confidently say that the audio performance is almost Identical. The WF-XM5 has a deeper base and more refined experience at lower volume. But I have noticed distortion with theWF- XM5 at high volume (80-90%)maybe an update will fix that.
The WF-XM5 has the superior noice canceling. But I find the foam tips to be uncomfortable and the weight causes pain in the ear after about 1.5-2 hrs of usage. Ho, btw with Link buds S I can sleep with them over the pillow without feeling pressure on my ears.
The Link duds S have better battery life than the XM5! I noticed my WF-XM5s lasting only 3-4 hrs of continuous usage, and the worst part is the charging case only holds 2-3 more charges. Link buds S with ANC-LDAC- on can last 5-6hrs on 50% volume. Battery life varies on usage and content.
I honestly think the WF-XM5 are like a refreshed WF-XM4 smaller footprint. But still not enough for it to be comfortable for prolonged use.
Save some money and get the Link buds S instead."
1692,Thanks for the input I have been struggling to find comfort with the xm5s honestly that being said I may just go ahead and exchange it for the link bud S because at that price range comfort should be the bare minimum. Im just an average music enjoyer that being said I’m sure I wouldn’t notice the difference in the Audio quality. Once again thanks for the input!
1693,Xm5
1694,Just picked them up thanks
1695,Google a good eq and keep ANC off or set to half a lot of the time is what I do. Fucking fantastic headphones
1696,Stupid question but why don’t you use the ANC at full? Also do you happen to have a protective case for the charging case?
1697,"Don't have a protective case but I never hurt my xm4s in the two years I've owned them it can take a drop or two.
ANC full is very strong and I only use it at home cuz I don't want to get hurt LOL like walk into traffic or accidentally ignore people. Half strength means you hear the important stuff"
1698,Knowing my clumsy self it’s gonna drop a couple times. Well good to know I’ll be putting the ANC on full blast when I’m at the gym. Anyways thanks for the help dude!!
1699,Might be able to get a rubber sorta thing off amazan
1700,Yeah I’m sure I’ll find a case as sturdy as my airpods case
1701,"I just got my case today from Amazon! A case is definitely the way to go, the XM5s are pretty great, but the charging case does feel kinda cheap to me. Not sure it could withstand a hard drop"
1702,Would you mind sharing the link?
1703,"I thought I shared this already but I guess it never finished posting. This is the one I got but you can definitely find others on Amazon 
Geiomoo Silicone Case for Sony... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCT1JXZZ?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share"
1704,"Sound and ANC wise - XM5
Comfort - Linkbuds S or get silicone tips for the XM5 (this is assuming your ears don't like foam tips)"
1705,I just picked em up thanks! Excited to unbox them!!!
1706,Nice let me know your thoughts!

1717,I wonder if a different ear tip size is needed for your left ear. I had a pair of buds in the past where that was needed for them to stay in.
1718,This happens to me too and I’ve found that I can alleviate a lot of it by adjusting them a little so that they fit juuuust right in my ears. I definitely can’t lay down with them in though or they hurt like hell

1729,Mine were waaaay out warranty.  I replaced both L & R earbud batteries myself.   I was so impressed with how well they held a charge after the repair I replaced the case battery as well.
1730,How and  where did you get the stuff to do it yourself l want to try. Don't even care if i brake them they only last like 40min now so yeah.
1731,"Bought both batteries on eBay.  For the buds, it's the Zenipower Z55H. For the case, you want a R-41130427.  You'll likely need a glue to put them back together like B-7000.  There are quite a few videos on YouTube which do an excellent job showing how to open the buds non-destructively.  Just search WF-10004 battery replacement and you'll find lots of info.    It's not difficult to do.  Just take your time.  If you start to get frustrated, walk away for an hour or two, re-watch a how to video on YouTube and try again. 👍🏻"

1743,"I just received these yesterday.  The bass was incredibly powerful.  I had to turn down the clear bass to 6 which was still very loud.  For some reason, the bass just disappeared today.  If I set it to 10 it is still nowhere near where it was yesterday.  I haven't had a firmware upgrade I believe.  It's on 1.5.0.
I have no clue what the issue is.  I have a good seal and the sound quality sounds fine otherwise.  I was super excited about these earbuds and now they are just meh.  Should I return these or try upgrading the firmware?  After a bit of googling I'm seeing a lot of issues due to the firmware."

1746,"So I recently bought these headphones and I just have one complaint. When I use them over Discord, the microphone just stops working after a while. I'm talking but they decide to randomly not work. Never had this problem before,  I have used Bluetooth headphones before and they worked fine. I can hear everyone else but the mic just decides to suddenly not pick up my voice. Is this a common problem with these headphones or what?
Seeing as this is half of the reason I bought them for, it sucks.
Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

1766,"I'll start by saying that I consider myself a headphone connoisseur, and a bit of an audiophile. I had a lot of wireless headphones among them:
Bose quick comfort 2
Sony wf1000xm4
Pixel buds pro
Galaxy buds2
Sennheiser momentum true wireless 3
Airpods pro 2
What I expect from headphones is that they be comfortable, the highest quality sound possible, good call quality that allows a conversation without sounding muffled, average noise filtering and a reasonable battery.
​
I'll start with the sound - the sound is very similar to the previous model, but with less kicking bass and sub bass. This means that the treble sounds will sound better. For me, the sound is really good, in that I enjoy listening to it like wired headphones. In the previous model there was a lack of the high sounds, compared to the current model that you feel them more along with the low sounds that you feel them well.
​
Comfort - This is individual, but for me they are comfortable enough for walking or to the gym while sweating.
​
Noise cancellation - the previous model and the current model are identical in this regard. Since Sony provides foam tips, they rely on passive rather than active noise isolation. I use silicone tips and I do hear vehicle engines and screams from outside. The filtering is good but not like airpods pro 2. Better than Sennheiser.
​
Call quality - from what I've been able to use so far, everyone I've talked to hasn't complained about any noise problem and when I asked how the call quality was, they said excellent.
​
Battery - the battery remains the same as in the previous model and that's great, it's enough for me.
​
Touch buttons - in my opinion, the touch buttons are more convenient than the previous generation, easier to find and press.
​
Features - the headphones have fast pair, which allows you to see the battery of the headphones without opening the application and allows you to use the Google location application to find the coverage. In addition, they have the ldac codec that allows you to listen to high quality music. This means that if you listen to flac files, you will feel the difference with it.
​
In terms of price, I would say it is a little expensive but it justifies itself. If we compare them to airpods pro 2, which are among the best headphones on the market (at least for me), the noise transparency situation is a little lacking and there are people who will not be comfortable with the Sony. Compared to the Bose, I would say that in terms of weight the Sony's convenience takes and also in terms of features. The Bose take a shortfall, whether it's seeing how much battery there is to cover or whether it's fast charging.  
feel free to ask any question!"

1768,"they rely on passive rather than active noise isolation 

are you referring to the noise cancellation, or just how much the tips block sound without the anc?"
1769,"Referring to the noise cancellation. If you put the silicon tips, you will hear more from the environment than with the foams tips, but I didn't like the feel of the foam."
1770,"isolation and cancellation are 2 different things though. 
the Sony's do not have passive noise cancellation it is active. the isolation would only be with the earbuds NC off."
1771,"Thanks for sharing my thoughts I did a bit of a mini review myself (not linking it since that’s not why I am responding) but you’re more of an audiophile to me.   
can you do some more testing with your mic. I didn’t hear much complaints at first but then I walked through a mall and they started coming in.  Can you try recording yourself with some fan noise etc and seeing how the recording sounds.  Mine was pretty bad were I may try to go to Best Buy or Sony for support."
1772,"Will try that and will write here my results.
Edit:what firmware did you use when you experienced bad call quality? Im in 2.0.1"
1773,I’m on the same one I updated fairly quickly. Made some calls before I did but it was in a quiet environment so I wouldn’t have known.
1774,"I tried and called in a mall with a lot of people and ahead of big fun. The results were that the other side still could hear me,  but I was a little muffled. But the other side understood every word I said"
1775,"Okay so that is better how it sounded for me. I was able to exchange mine and so far my own tests have been an improvement. I have to do some more testing and then out and about testing.  After that I will install the update, since on your end it is sounding as intended.
​
Thanks so much for trying it out!"
1776,"Sure! Let me know your results, I'm curious. It seems that they have some units with defects"
1777,"Yeah even with the 2.0.1 update fan noise is under control.  didn’t go anywhere to test for crowds, but signs are pointing to either a defective unit or a botched update;  
First device took multiple tries over 30-40 min (duration normal for Sony updates)  
2nd device took one try and in 10 min, the fastest Sony headphones updated I have ever experienced"
1778,"glad to hear! my sony took 40 minutes to finish the update, looks like you got a great unit!
so the call quality is good in the day to day situation"

1791,"I recently purchased a XR75X90K and I only stream tv; youtubetv, AppleTV, Netflix, Disney+, etc. My HDMI comes out of HDMI 3 (ARC) for my Sony sound system. Does the TV use HDMI 3 to stream tv? I can't find any labeling for when I'm streaming. I can't tell if the tv is running at 120hz or does it do that for in general for everything. I'm still getting some ghosting in shows and sports and blur. I thought this tv would've alleviated all that since it's one of Sony's top TVs. My motion setting is set to auto and cinema to max."

Sony uses a master/slave configuration for their earbuds. The ""master"" is whichever one has play/pause bound to it and the other is the ""slave"". Since only the ""master"" connects to your phone and the ""slave"" connects to the ""master"", you can only use the ""master"" by itself and not the ""slave"".
You can change the button bindings in the Headphones Connect app if you want to swap the ""master"" from the right to the left or vis versa."

1825,"So my Wh-1000xm3 headphones, which I really loved, got stolen/lost in Paris a week ago.  
I got the Sony Wh-1000xm4 in Berlin as an upgrade and I've been really excited having new headphones. It's really the noise canceling that matters to me, and I really treasured the Xm3's, but they didn't have Xm3's anywhere I looked.
My xm4's seem to have a problem int he right ear cup, and it's not the same at all, it's actually far more annoying.
The right earphone gives of pretty loud popping sounds, and also seems super sensitive to any physical motion of whatever bus/train I am on, every bump in the road there is a pressure shift or something, a change in the ANC.  
So those two things, a continuous popping sound that's not constant but really annoying when it happens, and the right side seems to struggle with physical motion, bumps.
And it's only the right side.  The left side is totally chill and seems to provide a completely uniform and we'll modulated ANC experience.
While motionless they are almost always totally fine, it's while moving the problems happen, and then only on the right side.
And I'm just... I don't know what to think... I feel anxious and disappointed.  
I was really able to let go of circumstances beyond my control and not be so bummed out my Xm3's were gone.  I let go and I was very happy to get new headphones.
But now I'm wondering, what the heck is going on?
The biggest reason I want headphones like this is to use on busses, trains, boats, airplanes etc!  They are meant to be my travel headphones, I bought the Xm3's for that purpose originally and they helped me so much because I am a very sensitive person. 
I had heard the Xm4's had even better ANC...?
Is there is something wrong with my pair I got?
I still have he box and receipt, I could perhaps RMA they to Sony when I get home from my trip...?
Or if there's some way to diagnose and fix the problem, through ANC software update or downgrade or reset or something.... That would be ideal.
I am trying to keep a positive attitude.  This Europe trip has been a good experience overall.
Any ideas?
My Xm3's did originally develop a problem with feedback in the left earphone when using the ANC, a static noise, that I found out comes from sweat/moisture accumulation inside the earcup and affected the ANC circuit.  I followed the advice of someone here on reddit, this subreddit I believe, and put a silicone gel packet inside the earcup, and it never bothered me again.  I always thought they were really amazing headphones even before the problem became obvious, and honestly it only happened after a while of wearing them anyways especially in humid climates. 
This problem with my new Xm4's seems very different.  I don't understand.  Is this this common with Xm4's?
Is this literally just normal or something and I am just noticing the ""improved ANC"" compared to the Xm3's?
Because it seems to be happening specifically while in motion, as a response to physical bumps and jolts and vibrations of whatever transport I am on."

1830,My guess is that the seal is being interrupted and auto pause is activating. one ear has a pressure sensor in it that turns off your headphones if you have turn off headphones when removed from head on. So turn off that option and see if that fixes it

1834,"Hello,
I can't find any documentation as to whether an ARC HDMI port is REQUIRED.
I have an Epson 3800 projector which doesn't have HDMI ARC. 
Standard configuration is (with Amazon Fire): Fire cube -> HDMI In on A9 box -> HMDI Out on A9 box to TV HDMI Arc port.
If I go Fire Cube -> HMDI In on A9 box -> HMDI out to regular HDMI port on projector
what would I be missing out on? Sound still plays.
Would I be better served going: Fire Cube -> HDMI extractor with optical out -> the HDMI goes to projector, Optical goes to optical/HMDI dongle back into A9 box?  Someone on reddit suggested that but it might be pointless. Thanks!"

1836,HDMI ARC (audio return channel) means the audio signal can come back from the device you are sometimes playing video to. You of course can just go in one direction - having a device connected to the HT A9 -> to the display device.
1837,Thank you! Ahh I see. So what happens without ARC? You get standard sound? Stereo? Just not the Dolby Atmos or more sophisticated surround sound?
1838,"If you go into its HDMI in, you will get what your device delivers. so Atmos, 7.1 or whatever.
<image>
With optical you will get either compressed 5.1 or uncompressed 2.0, so definetly worse."

There are a few videos on YouTube with people taking them apart or showing how they work, but that's it.

1843,"The XM5 has 2 modes. I'll call one ""call mode"" and one ""music mode"".
95% of the time the headset is in ""music mode"". But when joining eg. a voice chatroom, having a phone call and playing in some games. The headset swaps to this ""call mode"".
In ""call mode"" the sound quality drops significantly, the volume drops a lot and everything sounds extremely ""thin"". It sounds really weird and it's very annoying. The dynamic range is almost entirely gone too.
Is there some way to prevent it from swapping into this mode?
It's totally unnecessary. Because I can still talk, record and use the microphones in the standard ""music mode"" without any problems.
It's really starting to get on my nerve in some places because I just want to be able to hear things properly."

1864,"I have been liking my Linkbuds S so far. However, there is this problem that is really annoyed me.
When I started speaking, the earbuds would also turn on the ambient sound ( level 20) and it's really noisy. I usually listen in quiet place, with or without ANC on, the surrounding is pretty much quiet. However, whenever i have phone call the Linkbuds S turns on ambient sound on automatically and makes it really noisy. I can't focus on my phone call because of the noise.
​
Other than that, sometime the earbuds would also turn up and down the volume although it wasn't my intention to do so. I still don't understand how to use the earbuds probably after 2 days using it.
​
Please help me. I want to know how to turn off the ambient sound forever and understand the mechanism of controlling volume of the Linkbuds S by voice.

1866,"Sorry, but I do not have the App in front of me. But in the headphones app, there is a setting that a couple settings that you want to look for. The main one has to do with the earbuds automatically adjusting to your environment. Once you turn that off, it will switch around a lot less. Then, you can also adjust the volume of ambient sound and it should stay at the volume you set it at.
But yes the linkbuds S will occasionally still switch around on me. The good news is that with a single tap to the left earbud it switches it back to noise cancelling."

1911,"I have a 65"" X90CJ TV that has two dark spots in the screen. Not dead pixels, but about an inch in diameter dark spots. 
Sony is saying I have dust INSIDE my screen and has offered a goodwill replacement with an XR65X90CK. I'm not sure if this is a reasonable swap? I'd lose the extended warranty I have and the new unit is on sale for 70% of what I paid for the original. 
Any tips?"

1913,"It’s the next year’s newer model than your version. They have some minor pros and cons each but overall K has updated hardware, a bit brighter and is considered better after the newer firmware updates (it was considered not as good only early on with early reviews of the early firmware but has overall since matured better).
Price is not indicative since you probably bought yours outside sales or when new and now K is on clearance to make room for the newer L series. 90 series often goes on sale for markdowns starting around Black Friday. K is more valued since it has newer firmwares and new 2023 features like the new game bar which Sony has not yet given to the J and older models.
The biggest issue I think is, how much warranty time will you lose?"
1914,"I'd lose the 3 year Allstate warranty That costco sells. In Looking at it closer, it might not be worth a whole lot? 
What about asking for the ""L"" instead? Maybe they'll go for it?"
1915,"If you can get the L that is definitely superior to both. But if not, I’d personally be happy with the K over the J.
As for warranty you maybe could get it separately for your new one. Definitely do get it in case failure or panel issues develop like your J did."
1916,Thanks a ton for the input. I'll see what I can do on getting the L and another warranty.
1917,Good luck!
1918,"Well, they claim that there are no L models in stock and no expected date for getting any. The offer for a K stands so I guess thats the best I can get. They mentioned that I will need to contact Costco to get warranties transferred, not sure how that will work out but I guess I will find out."
1919,"It’s just coming onto the market so it’s probably barely meeting the new supply demands. 
K is still a really nice set and if it fails again down the line maybe by then mini LEDs might be in the X90 line up!"

TV plays audio from movies if I stumble into one but will not display a picture. I can see the backlights turn on but just stays black. I tried doing all the normal hard resets with no luck. Looking online I believed the problem was most likely the TCON board and ordered a replacement. 
I just finished replacing the TCON and still have the exact same issue. Anyone have any ideas on how to diagnose the issue from here?

1924,"I was thinking about buying a new set of headphones but I can't decide whether the xm5s are worth the extra money or if the xm4 are enough. The things I mainly need are anc, no sounds leaks, sound quality and the controls on the headphones themselves. Any tips?"

1926,"I bought xm5 after I broke my xm4’s, returned them and “downgraded” to xm 4, better build, better sound quality, better travel case, more comfort wearing them, better bass, all in all a better product. Xm5’s is a product constructed with the shareholders stakes at mind “where can we shave a nickel and a dime”, the xm4 is a product made by the Sony engineers “let’s make a studio grade headset sounding, user friendly product that’s affordable for almost everyone, and let’s not market them at all, we’ll just drop them in the mix with all the other headsets that are a little bit cheaper, and the consumers that figure it out will figure it out” all in all the other consumers pay for the xm customers experience in nature and that’s just the facts :) (I’ve also had the HUGE Apple max headsets and they are twice as bad sounding as the are insanely ugly and heavier than a motorcycle helmet) and I’m an Apple fanboy (and x employee as a fact ) The xm4, still the best product out there, and will be until xm6 comes, but we’ll need the “suits” out of the development team before that happens, the xm5’s are a disgrace."
1927,Are they that bad? I liked their design so much :(
1928,"I had a battered old pair of the original MDR 1000X's, they recently broke and I got a like new pair of XM5's which were the same price as XM4's. 
I prefer the aesthetics of the XM5, and although they don't fold down as compactly, I tend to wear them whenever I'm travelling so I don't find that to be such an issue. As for the build quality, I actually had two 1000X's - on both pairs the headband snapped despite my careful use. As far as I'm aware, it was the same broad design until the XM5's, and I have heard that the change in form factor is to prevent this from happening, although that could be marketing BS. 
Bottom line, go with your gut. They both sound good, and are comfortable."
1929,"They’re ok, xm4’s are brilliant."
1930,But are they brilliant because they're really THAT much better or because the price is better?
1931,"They’re just better all in all, like I’ve mentioned earlier in detail:) xm5’ s are more of a milking cow of sorts, there’s a reason why xm4 hasn’t been pulled from the market, still in production at a wild price point, those who prefer xm5’s haven’t tried 4 or are just convinced that newer is always better. In this case they are wrong."
1932,You should probably specify WH (over-ear) or WF (earbuds). There are two XM4 and two XM5 models now
1933,"WH, sorry"
1934,"Gotcha, I only have experience with the WF XM3/4/5 so I unfortunately cannot contribute"
1935,"Not sure why someone downvoted you, this is absolutely correct, and I came to say the same lol"
1936,Don’t have the XM5s but my XM4s is freaking amazing
1937,"I assume you mean the WH and not WFs. The XM4s are probably enough for what you need. I remember worrying I'd regret my XM4 purchase when the XM5s were announced but from what I can tell, the differences are pretty minimal (and the new headphone/case design sucks imo). If you can get a good deal on the XM4s I'd say to get those."
1938,"Differences are minimal. And some find the XM5's a bit tricky to find the correct seal . I don't have those problems with mine so to each their own.  But for portability, I would say the XM4s"
1939,I don't really need portability tbh. Did you have any problems so far?
1940,"None on my end, I’ve really enjoyed them."
1941,don’t buy the xm5 I’ve had them since Friday & they have a creaking noise when using noise cancellation or ambient sound only way to stop it is to turn off both & the audio aint much better get the xm4 cheaper & better
1942,"I have the same issue with my XM3, not with the XM5 though.
Mediamarkt states there's nothing wrong with it and won't repair it."
1943,I took the hit had to trade them into 2nd shop as Sony wasn’t helpful bought a different brand
1944,"If U want to control volume, xm5 otherwise xm4. Both are excellent. I chose the wf1000xm5 because i need Volume Control on my earbud"
1945,"I was talking abt the WH, forgot to mention it in the post"
1946,"I had the same doubt but love the xm4s, I think the differences are too minimal for the price difference and as everyday normal users the xm4s are more than enough"
1947,"I thought I might spend a bit more since I keep headphones for years, also I like the xm5s design more tbh lol"
1948,WH or WF?
1949,"WH, sorry forgot to mention it"
1950,"Ahh ok, good to know, as I was in the same boat as you. I ended up getting the 5's because the better microphones and I liked the design better, the swivel cups seem more durable imo. I got them for $70 off on prime day, and I could spare the extra cash. even though the 4's were like $100 chaper than the 5's. If you can, maybe wait till black friday to see what the prices are. I also sued $20 in cashback reward points on my prime card, so that helped a bit too."
1951,"I was thinking about the 5s too because I just like them more design wise and the better anc, but a dude wrote me an essay about why the 5s are a disgrace to mankind (he said that) and the 4s are the best thing to ever exist and now I'm just so confused.
Did you have any issues?"
1952,"Best headphones I've ever owned honestly. I use em sometimes 10 - 12 hours a day every day and they are great. I wouldn't listen to that guy personally. Almost sounds like he's trying to cope with not having the 5s or something idk lol. It also depends on what you want them for. I listen to music all day and I do voice calls on teams and phone calls, the mic and anc on the 5s are better, and I've heard they are more comfy for extended wear, so I spent more and got 5s"
1953,"I listen to music a lot and don't really do calls, but I want to bring them to some really loud places so I really want a good nc, anc or whatever it's called I don't know the difference lol. Sometimes I use my headphones for gaming, do you know if the delay is good in bluetooth?
I think I will go with the 5s for the nc and just because I like the design, I don't need portability because I mostly stay at home and when I bring them with me I always have a backpack to carry other stuff I need for the place, but I'm still a bit scared lmao"
1954,Can I ask you how you feel about the adaptive sound thing? I've seen a lot of people hate the automatic nc and there's no way to change it even in the app
1955,"The auto ANC is annoying, but you can change it in the app to just use ANC all the time. It tries to use AI or whatever to adapt the ANC to your surroundings, or like if you're moving vs stationary etc. I just turned off the auto, and it's just regular old ANC all the time"
1956,"Oh so I can just turn it off from the app? Thank you so much, I'm getting the 5s when the price drops a bit in my country"
1957,Xm4 more comfortable than xm5
1958,"Maybe you should consider buying something else? (not sony). I mean, 1000XM4's are amazing, I had a lot of good time with them, sound quality is superior, but after 1,5 year they started to make a high pitched noise that deafened me for couple of days. Also, sony didn't accept the warranty so I am left with broken headphones now..."
1959,Have the xm5s now. Not worth the money at all. Maybe worth if you get a 20% discount. Nothing special in sound quality. Build quality isnt great. Very sensitive to sweat or drops. Regret my purchase. I've used xm4s that went through hell and they sound the same if not better
1960,"I bought a pair of xm4's a couple of days ago and I'm loving them so much. I tried both in-store and can say the noise cancellation was slightly better on the XM5. Sound quality was pretty similar, but I preferred the stronger bass of the xm4, wondering if that's due to the smaller drivers in the xm5. 
Also, I reckon the ear cups felt better on the xm4. Either way, from all the research I'd done for my own purchase, the general consensus seemed to be that both are fantastic headphones you're not going to be disappointed with, no matter which one you go for.
Personally the lack of foldability was the deal breaker for me with the xm5
."
1961,"I think I'm getting the 5s because I just like the design more and I like the idea of the cups being a bit bigger, noise cancelation as well. A dude called the 5s ""a disgrace"" tho lol.
Is the bass difference very noticeable or is it subtle?"
1962,"XM5's for me. 
For me:

Slightly bigger earcups. That being said, I found both XM4 and XM5's to be both very comfortable for long listening sessions...
Better mic for calls. I use my headphones at work for teams/zoom/conference calls. They work great! The mic on the MX4's is ok in a quiet room, but not great when a bit of noise is in your surroundings...
Slightly better ANC, thought it's really on only noticeable testing back to back. That being said, the ANC of the XM5's is much better in windy conditions. 
Multi-point with LDAC support 

One negative is that the XM5's don't fold down like the XM4's do. In practice I haven't found it to be an issue, but it could be an issue for others..."

1967,"I have a PS-LX300USB stereo system. I've had it for at least 5 years. I haven't changed the needle before, but recently some records sound a little distorted vs others sound just fine. My speakers aren't the greatest, but when some albums are sounds a little more odd than I think they should I thought I'd ask for some suggestions.
One of the albums I've noticed sounded off was 'Strange Trails' by Lord Huron. I had bought the album brand new, so there shouldn't be anything wrong with it, so why did some songs sound slightly distorted? 
Any help is well appreciated, and thank you very much for the help."

1973,"Up to this point I only recorded sound design tutorials with a screen recording software and audio. 
I want to also record myself (keyed in front of a green screen) with a Sony EZ V10.
Other subreddits suggested to look into OBS to integrate the screen recording, my external audio and the camera recording (with a capture card). And then to edit woth Davinci Resolve. 
So far so good. 
I'm still confused about 4K and 1080 HD and which format and resolution to choose. 
1) Is it best practice to record myself (in front green screen) with the Sony EZ V10 in 4K even if I will resize myself to place myself in the right bottom corner of the screen? Because 4K will neee more CPU and GPU power. 
2) I saw a youtube video where someone mentioned that the 1080p output on a Sony is worse than on other cameras? Is that so?
That would suggest to do everything in 4K despite the CPU / downscale issue. 
3) I'm in Europe. Is it correct to choose a specific shutter speed (or is it frame rare) because of the different AC (vs US)? 
4) Do I record everything in 24 or 30 frames/sec?"

1975,"In OBS you put your screen as one source and the ZV1 as another - then you key the greenscreen in OBS.
Later you cut it in whatever software you use.
If I were you I would get a HDMI capture card, as the Sony cameras can only output 1024*766 or some weird resolution in the webcam mode they have build in due to bandwidth limitations.
I suggest the Elgato Camlink."

I have turned the headphones on a few times, but they depleted simultaneously. Now it doesn't even turn on anymore. I have read that the blinking indicates a abnormal temperature, but when I touch the headset, it is fine.

1993,"Hi,
Can somebody help me figuring out whats wrong with the connections and the sound?
I recently moved to a new appartment, and when i connected the HDMI cables as i did before, i most often get no sound from apple tv which is connected to the tv and gets the sound from the ARC input. I have xbox and BD player connected directly to the soundbar with HDMI 1 and 2 ports in the soundbar, and they both work.
HDMI 3 (ARC) is the sony tv ARC connection. Connected to the HDMI arc connection on the soundbar. Apple tv is connected to the tv hdmi port. On the soundbar it only says «D.IN», when it should say «TV ARC» when proparly working.
I have tried numerous HDMI cables in the ARC port on the tv to the soundbar. No luck.
What problems can it be?
Help is much appriciated."

2020,"my ps5 fan is not working.
Yesterday when i was about to play MW2 on my ps5, it shut down suddenly. When i turned it on again, i realized my console has become really warm. After waiting for few mins, i turned it back on and i got this message ""ps5 is hot, please wait for some time"". So i turned my ps5 off and opened the panel. As it turns out, my fan is not working. But i can play games though, for a very short period. What maybe the issue ? Could it be an issue with the motherboard ? Is it the fan ? Should i replace it with another ?  Note: my fan is all dusty and shit but still turns when i give it a whirl(won't completely start spinning though.).So should i clean the dusts off ? 
Also, i live in india and i bought this ps5 on the launchday itself. So im out of warranty. I called the service centre and they said no repairs. How ever they'll exchange it for a discount price. Facepalm. 
Any suggestions ? Anyone ?"

I’ve heard from multiple people that it only outputs linear PCM 5.1 (the surround sound supported by the Switch) through the HDMI port. My surround system does not have a HDMI port and I’m wondering if it will output PCM 5.1 through the optical port. I can’t find an answer online, so thought I’d ask here."

I know this might be a dumb question and I know that the audio won’t play on that video, but why is the video pausing randomly?"

I had to spend about 3 hours on hold to get the right tech support person with ATT to run me through the manual configuration settings to get me connected to their network (which at the time at least also didn't support this phone)."

2076,"Best thing I’ve heard coming out of a government agency in a while. To cancel my internet subscription, after my contract was completed, I had to sit on the phone with someone for an hour. I kept repeating “I already have a new provider setup and running, nothing you say will make me change my mind” and they just kept putting me on hold for for 5 minutes and then coming back and asking if I’m sure I want to leave. That’s nowhere near the worst if it. I remember my dad spending 4.5 hours on the phone with SiriusXM trying to cancel years back link

I searched across 7202 comments/posts and   found something that is pretty similar. The above, written by /u/jNushi is the most closely related to what /u/nt-assembly wrote, with a similarity score of 87.376 / 100 (medium, possibly similar):

2080,"When I go outside and I have noise cancelling on, it gets so deafening, kind of like it is amplifying the wind sound. I understand that this is because the headphones use the built in mic for ANC. Do the XM4's have the same problem? What about the XM5s? The wind noise just get SO loud and overbears anything that I play."

2082,Sounds like they aren’t fitted properly to your ear. I’ve had the XM4’s since 2021 and just got the XM5’s. Neither have the issue you’re describing above.
2083,"I just had the xm3 and never had that issue. Your problem is that you’re putting it to total noise cancelling which is that result but if you go on the app and take it down a level (or 2?) it has a setting for wind reduction in which you still get really good noise cancelling but no wind and that is a lifesaver because I live in Wellington NZ which is the windiest city in the world!
When you have time download the app and look up wind reduction xm3 (online) and a step by step on how to do it should come up!"

2085,"Have the soundbar connected to the TV via the eARC. Also have a 2019 Nvidia Shield connected to the TV via HDMI. The Shield is my go to streaming device for all of my TVs, so I prefer to use that instead of the built-in interface that comes with the TV. The soundbar generally works with whatever I watch on it correctly, but it does have an annoying bug (not sure if the issue is with the soundbar or the TV itself) where on one or two apps I use, the soundbar loses connection to the TV and won't play sound if it is paused for too long (like after just a few minutes) and another app where I really can't play any videos without the soundbar losing the signal after a minute or two. Saw that others had some issues with soundbars connected to Sony televisions, so I thought I would ask here. Anyone have any ideas what the issue could be?"

Today I go to the cafe that I go to almost everyday to work on my laptop and suddenly my laptop connected to my lost earbuds that are 20% charged. The staff here can't find them. I have been to the cafe after I lost them and my laptop did not connect to them before, but today they did. I sit in different places in the cafe. I took my laptop and walked around the cafe to see if they would disconnect, but they are still connected. I lost them about a week ago they would have been dead by now. Makes no sense.

2100,"So basically my dad bought this back in 2008 or 9 and has been with our family for a very long time. And after years of keeping it in our family, my dad wants to let it go, but since I grew around it , I really want to keep it with us. 
His point being that it basically only runs radio, cassette and dvd. We could always use an aux cable, but since most of the phones don’t have the port of it anymore, it’s kinda dumb. And the dongles that we buy keep breaking. 
One way that I thought I could convince him is by maybe adding Alexa or Bluetooth to it. 
Any idea how one may do that?
Using it as a speaker for TV is out, because we already have home theatre system."

Is it better in noisy situations? 
How's the battery life?

Is it as loud as the beats? (Ik the XM5's don't get as loud)"

2109,Can't speak for max volume as having great ANC means not needing to care about that stuff so that you can protect you hearing. But ANC definitely better & sound definitely better.  Battery life should be better than the beats especially if they are used.  Hope this helps.

So use your warranty and exchange process with the retailer if still available.
Consider trying to get extra warranty protection from your retailer or the above link."

But the software runs well, like it'll show the status of my H7. but just no sound comes out from it. And when I uninstalled the Inzone Hub. Everything goes well. OK for output and input.

2149,"So, I have the WF-1000XM4 model of Sony's earbuds and after a couple months, issues with the left earbud began. It would randomly stop making noise, but it would resume. Now, no matter what I do, sound doesn't come from the left one. I've deleted the app, turned off the power, and even tried a factory reset (open & close 5 times trick). The factory reset one used to work but now it doesn't. Nothing works. Anyone got a solution ?"

2157,"Same thing he’s been happening to me for about a week or so. Seems like it’s getting worse. Today I turned them on to listen to a 2 minute song and counted it stopping and starting my music a total of 12 times before I just turned them off in frustration. 
My guess is that if it’s not in the settings (speak to chat function picking up ambient noise as a prompt) then it’s probably a malfunction in the touchpad. 
I previously had an issue where if I tried to fast forward a song it would NEVER stop skipping forward, even after executing other functions. Wouldn’t stop until I turned the headphones off and on and since then I honestly haven’t been bothered to try. 
Now I’m trying to decide if I can fix this myself or if I should ship them in for repair. Hoping I’ll find the answer on this sub"

2159,"Has anyone got the swanking new ES5000/7000 receivers? The literature is very limited. I'm looking to upgrade from a Yammy A3070 and I'm considering these 2 models in particular.
Basic doubts.
I'm planning to run Atmos channels wireless, so does it support it. And if yes can I run 2-4-6 simultaneously?
I already have 2 Rythmik subs. Now I also believe you can add 2 Sony wireless subs. Can I theoretically run 2 sw5 wirelessly while running 2 Rythmik wired?"

2162,"I got my motherboard fried last week and i got my pc repaired today. everything fine but when i turned it on in my room my tv was not showing display. In the livingroom the hdmi/pc was perfectly fine. Tried again in my room but not working. 
I tried 3hdmi cables. Bought a new one for my room still useless.
I did not try the reseting tv thing because my tv is in the livingroom for now as im using the working one as a monitor.
I had my Sony tv for 4-5 years now and it always worked. My pc is perfectly fine but in my room I has security cameras conected to the tv as monitor. I switced hdmi spots with them and the cameras work perfectly in both but my pc does not. I can't explain why my pc will work on my other tv and the cameras work fine in both hdmi ports in the tv that is in my room. 
CAn anyone help? I tried almost everything."

2164,"Did you change anything on the PC other than the MB?
Have you tried a different HDMI port on your TV?"
2165,Yes all two of them. I had changed my mother board and gpu. They work perfectly fine with the tv from the living room but not mine
2166,"If it’s an Nvidia GPU there are signal bugs with Sony TVs ever since Nvidia changed firmwares about a year ago that started issues.
For newer Sony TVs, using VRR setting in the HDMI ports or limiting to 60hz port works. No idea how your older version can bypass those bugs.
Update to the newest firmware for both Sony TV and GPU. You may also need to try older than 1 year old Nvidia firmwares and try various other versions to see what may work.
If that doesn’t work you’ll have to contact Nvidia support."
2167,"My gpu will be changed very soon as for my tv the one in my room that doesn’t work should be from 2018 and the gpu I’ll get came out around 4.5 years. My tv was working perfectly since a storm that friend my motherboard and gpu. My tv works perfectly fine. I can’t do much right now but thank you for the information. 
Is there any way to fix my tv (older one)?"
2168,"If the drivers don’t work, then no. As far as I know it took Nvidia a year to recently fix it for newer Sony TVs but even then there’s still various bugs like audio cutting out. So it is still being worked on to be fixed.
You’ll have to contact Nvidia. Given your Sony TV is old and unsupported, you may need to consider an older GPU like you had before or to upgrade to a newer TV, if you can’t find a solution.
So keep trying various driver versions and contact Nvidia in the meantime or whoever new GPU you get."
2169,Not sure if you know but I’ve seen online that people mostly have this issue with Nividia 3gen or 4 gen. My gpu at the moment is a 710 (very old) so I honestly do not understand why it’s not working. The tv from my living is from 2015 and is perfectly fine with it. My old gpu was from the 1000 series and I’m going to upgrade to a 2000 soon but I’m afraid it might not work and I’ll spend money on nothing
2170,"Hard to say for sure but it’s the only change you’ve made since this problem started.
If you have other HDMI devices like a game console, try testing it on your TV that’s giving you problems. If those don’t work either then you know the HDMI ports/component of the TV is busted."
2171,I have some security cameras that I have in my other hdmi port and they work perfectly fine in my tv but not my pc and this is why I’m freaking out because the pc is working perfectly fine and my tv as well
2172,"I would test an HDMI 2 device like another computer, laptop or console.
But yes my assumption is based on everything you’ve tested and ruled out that there’s a compatibility handshake issue between the TV and the GPU.
Have you tried different GPU drivers, both older than the one you have and newer? You may need to try a lot of versions to find one that works. It is a long shot though."
2173,I had an old GTX 1660 Phoenix that worked perfectly until a storm fried it. My current one is a GT 710 gpu (from 2014 release date) and I’ll switch this month (hopefully) to a RTX 2060 asus dual (release date around 2019). I had no problem with my GTX 1660 with this tv. I hope and pray the new gpu will work and if not I’ll have to buy a monitor. I’m really upset this happened as I blew over 2k lei on my pc just so my tv won’t work

2177,To get them out of the case. You are apparently supposed to first angle them outwards then pull them up and out.
2178,"No issues with touch controls, easy to get out of the case… and where them like this photo…
<image>"
2179,"1) That glossy finishing is OK for years 2000's but totally ridiculous nowadays.
2) That finishing makes it really difficult to remove it from the case and also from the ears.
I also have the XM3... There is no big deal on XM5.
The sound is basically the same and I can't notice any real advantage on the noise cancelling during the flight, compared against XM3"
2180,"Really? I also have the XM3 and really wanted to get the new XM5, you're saying it's not worth it?"
2181,"Really? I also have the XM3 and really wanted to get the new XM5, you're saying it's not worth it?"
2182,"The only big difference is the size.
XM5 earbud is smaller.
The case is much smaller.
The sound is basically the same.
The noise cancelling is basically the same.
Save you money."
2183,Ikr thought the noise canceling would be great
2184,"The difference on the noise level between XM3 and XM5 is just because there is a foam plug (that thing that fit in your ears) on XM5, but it is much more uncomfortable than that one used on XM3.
The only real difference between them is just the size. XM5 is smaller.
Save your money..."
2185,"Just bought a new pair of xm3 for 200 gonna return xm5
<image>"
2186,There’s a technique to get them out kinda have to tilt them first with one finger but the glossy finish on them is brutal. I find they’re louder than my m4s so you might just not have them snug in your ears.
2187,To get them out of the case just push the bud straight back toward the door with your thumb. Left hand for left bud. Right hand for right. You can do it with 1 finger
2188,Youreally  find them less loud than the 3?
2189,I'd like that to not be reality but i gotta bump up the volume by 3 clicks more to hear the same also whenever I shake my head they rattle make a weird sound like a suction cup popping
2190,"Damn, well that is interesting. It's something for me to consider as my xm3 left side arm just broke and I was thinking about upgrading soon.
Thanks."
2191,I've had a ton of issues with xm3 but if something is good enough once they work properly it's great have a pair coming up on 3 Years I still get 4h per charge
2192,"I have the wfh1000xm4 and they suck bc this question is exactly what is wrong with the 1000xm4 When I try to turn the volume up bc when I try they don’t work correctly. I think Sony dropped the ball on the 4,5 and with the price you pay they should be great"

2203,"Hello
Just got myself an inzone M9 yesterday. The image in SDR is amazing, but whenever I turn on HDR everything gets a green hue (especially white/gray/transparent stuff). When playing rift apart I could somewhat minimize the issue by putting the white point pretty high in that game.
But I can't seem to get it to display hdr video (or anything else in HDR for that matter) properly, always has this green shimmering  on whatever white there is.
On another note: I can't get the display to do 144hz with a brand new hdmi 2.1 cable. With my old displayport 1.2 cable in dp 1.4 mode 144hz does work.
Firmware is fully updated and 10bit colour is enabled.
Is this an issue with the panel itself or with the cables? Or is there some setting on the screen that mitigates this? Thanks in advance."

2205,Hdmi 2.1 can’t do 4k 144hz on pc. Only DisplayPort can (use 1.4 and above.) when It comes to the Inzone m9. I have two on a dual monitor set up
2206,"Thanks, ordered a DP1.4 , that way I'll get VRR support (which I didn't get on my dp1.2 obviously)  
Contacted sony support for my green hdr problem, let's see how that goes"
2207,Yeah I know on pc via hdmi 2.1 you will get max 120. Idr if you get vrr with it on pc. But you will get 120 vrr when hooked to a ps5 via hdmi 2.1
2208,"I do get vrr with the hdmi 2.1 cable, just no 144hz"
2209,Does it have that green hdr problem during a game and or if connected to a playstation
2210,"I didn't test with a playstation. Just with my pc (both in games, watching movies and general use) and a chromecast 4K hdr. 
Both got the exact same issue so it seems to be an issue with the display rather than anything else. I'll try with the displayport 1.4 cable when I get it in. Hope it works that way, but I'm not counting on it."

2218,"Hello, I just found this CMT-CP11 and it still works! One of the two speakers is a bit scratchy sounding (i’m sure that’s the accurate term), I was wondering if it was worth getting it fixed? If not can I play music from only one speaker? A friend told
me I can if there is a “mono” option but I don’t see a button for it. Also I don’t have a remote. Should I buy one or can I do almost everything directly on the console?
Also can I somehow play music from my phone on it with an adapter or aux cable or something?
I want to add pictures but i don’t know how to do that on reddit. 
Again, I know nothing about all this stuff. 🙃
Thanks for your help"

2258,"I got home from work yesterday evening, out of the shower and bluetoothed some music from my iPhone 11(iOS16.5.1) to my STR-DH790 around 6pm.
After I'd settled in a bit more I switched over to my 2015 MacBook Pro(macOS Monterey 12.6.8) to watch some videos on Youtube and used the bluetooth to stream the audio to my AVR as the MBs speakers seem to be dying.
I watched some Amazon Prime via my TV for about an 90 minutes before I ended up playing the PS4 for a couple of hours. So no bluetooth used for around 4 hours.
I usually listen to music when I go to bed, something to drift off to, so I usually just bluetooth music from my iPhone to my AVR.
Trying to connect my iPhone to my AVR around 11pm and it wouldn't connect.
I tried ""forgetting"" AVR in the iPhones menus, but after that it would not find it again.
This morning I've tried both my iPhone and my MB and neither will connect any more, and after removing the STR-DH790 from both devices menus they will detect but no longer connect to the AVR.
I've tried looking on Sonys help page for the STR-DH790 but it doesn't have anything that helps my situation.
The AVR is just under 4 years old, I bought it around September/October 2019 so it should still be under warranty with the shop I bought it from, and is used daily for Xbox, Playstation, Blu-Ray player, and most nights for streaming music via bluetooth.
I'd like to trouble shoot this issue before I make the 90 minutes round trip to the shop to have them look at it under warranty."

Yes I’ve reinstalled my Nvidia drivers, Yes I’ve preformed a custom clean install of the drivers, Yes I have restarted and unplugged both my TV and my PC, Yes I have swapped between Ports 3 and 4.

Incompatible aux cables can cause that. 
If not, I'd contact your point of purchase for a return. If beyond the return window, contact Sony for warranty. I have no clue why you say you're 'throwing them out' when they come with warranty."

2297,"Hi all
Need to decide between:
a) 65 inch x82L which is a LED TV without local dimming
and
b) 55 inch x90L which is a Full Array LD tv
The former is actually about 10% cheaper than the latter. Budget driven decision.
So the query in other words is, should I be prioritising size or is the picture quality so much different that it’s worth going for option b, and sacrifice size?
My usage : late night movies in a semi dark room primarily. Viewing distance : about 10 feet
This is to replace an ageing 10 year old Samsung 46 inch LED. So if I go 55, it’s a 42% area increase. With the 65 inch, it’s a 100% area increase.
Thanks for your help!
Cheers
Amit"

2299,"It’s personal taste and use case. Depends how important to you deeper blacks are and image processing. For example in a dark or night scene, a candle would turn all the blacks or night scenes into grey and the glow of a candle or light source would spread throughout the entire screen, on an X90 the glow would be limited to what it should more realistically look like while preserving deeper blacks and controlling the light source. 
For casual TV viewers who are not as picky, a larger screen would be better. But if you are picky about deeper blacks or image quality or game features, X90 is much better. So it depends."
2300,X90 would be my choice. If you can try to find a older 65” 900 or x90 to make the price closer to the x82 I’d do that.
2301,"Thanks so much u/Lassic22 , u/Leafs44 and u/Nice_Egg_2673 for taking time out to reply, and for sharing your thoughts.
Have decided to stick to 65 inch only (so as to be a substantial update on my current 46 inch tv).
I checked out x82L 65 and x90L 65 in stores, and side by side, in 2 stores. Both salesmen were pushing heavily for the x90L. The older x90K, J etc are not available where I live.
Both demos were in an extremely bright environment; and from some Bravia core movie playback, I could see maybe a 15% difference in quality (subjective, I know, and it was only a 10 minute demo in a less than ideal environment). The concerns are:
a) I will be watching primarily in a dark environment, and primarily Netflix, Prime kind of content. Not much of sports, or games etc.
b) I am concerned about eye-strain, with a 1000 nits panel, though definitely the blacks look good.
Still, leaning towards the 90, though 80L is a wonderful value for money. Absolutely maddening decision, since you have to live with your choice for a minimum of 5 years :)
Cheers
Amit"
2302,I think whatever you pick you’ll definitely be enjoying it. Good luck!
2303,"My 32 inches TV which used to be huge when I bought it. Now it is small to be honest, you are not exactly getting an OLED or qd oled in 55 inches next time when you upgrade you will definitely go for a bigger size even though it might be after five or 10 years. Why not just do that now next time you want me to upgrade from 55 to 65 again in the rare five or 10% cases, you won’t be glad that you bought55 inches with better quality. In most cases, you will be happy that you went with the bigger screen which is not average or bad quality at all."

2309,"Hi there. Long shot if anyone can help but having this super weird issue with my Sony HT-S400 sound bar setup. It’s paired with a a Sony X90K tv. 
The issue is that the sub seems to go super quiet (to almost nothing) as soon as I adjust the bass level with the remote. Doesn’t matter if I turn the bass up or down. Sub just goes into super quiet mode regardless. Almost like it’s activating nighttime mode. 
The sub also randomly adjust itself to nothing for seemingly no reason. 
Sub connection light is green and have tried playing with various setting, including resetting the sound bar. Sub does not appear to have a reset function.
Anyone got an idea?"

Even more easy way would to unpair both from windows and sony then recconect"

At EU even if warranty is 2 years, but consumer should expect that device lasts 5 years without problems = companies have to fix it for free.

2363,"Hi all
This is for Android users.
I have been really struggling with figuring out how to force my 1000xm5 to be at its best when paired with my phone. For reference its S23 Ultra.
I always go for best audio quality, hear it or not, placebo or not, I want the best that can be offered for the price I paid.
We all know the struggle of toggling audio quality of LDAC  through dev options on every BT connect. Here is how I solved it:
1) I downloaded Bluetooth Codec Changer
I paid for premium to have it on auto-change (3$), but you can just do it easily without by dragging down the notifications and clicking Auto-Switch
2) In this app I set up my LDAC: 96, 24, 990
Important: enable 2-step switch
Important: force delay to execute by 5-7 sec
3) Download Sony Music Center
Settings: LDAC sound quality and auto-start
Voila, everytime you connect your headphones they first go to 96/32 but best effort = this is Sony MC.
After a few seconds it toggles 96/24 ans 990 through the BCC app. This is also crucial that it changes the bitrate which forces through the actual quality change.
Hope this helps
PS: on every restart i still have to push through the auto change setting on BCC app, but after any BT connect picks up the desired settings
Edit: spelling and added PS"

2365,"Go to developer options (its hidden, there are many guides how to do this on any phone) then go to the section that shows bluetooth options and codecs. Force it to only use the best settings when possible. You can also select your headphones in the bluetooth device settings (not dev mode, just normal) And toggle LDAC/High quality sound switch. The app should also have a ""prioritize sound quality"" setting at the bottom which also forces LDAC via the app. I hope at least one of these helps you out.
EDIT: I use the base unlocked galaxy S23 (through verizon, but it is the unlocked model) and I use the WF-1000XM4 buds as my daily drivers. I also have a motorola razr 2019 that works perfectly with them too."

2370,"I bought these second hand and have some questions.
For starters I know I should drop expectations of good/boosted bass.  I have proper over the ear headphones for that kind of listening. I bought these for playing Ingress and being able to enjoy chores while hearing my wife holler from across the house.
There is, however, a disruptive/distracting crackle in my right ear bud when the bass peaks.  It's got the rattle of a blown out and/or dying driver.
I can still enjoy the headphones if my phone volume is at 1/2 and I use the equalizer and drop the bass boost to -10 and completely drop the low range. It's plenty loud and there's no rattle.  The music is understandably flat with this setting.
Should I expect to have to do this to avoid damaging these things?"

2373,Hello! I've been trying to use my xm5's with my laptop for a while it worked for a little the first time then I accidentally turned on airplane mode while connected to the headphones and they disconnected and when I reconnected they didn't show up in audio outputs while I'm connected with Bluetooth I've looked multiple places for a fix and its been 2 days when I disable it in device manager it kinda works like its there in the audio outputs but when I select its very muffled and goes to call mode which is like when you get in a call and in the options its stuck at 16bit with no other option but then it disappears again I tried initializing the headphones and repairing them they work fine with my phone I've used them on my other pc for a very long time with no problems but they wont work with my laptop and its very frustrating. Thank you for taking the time to read this

55-210 mm I would not pay more than 50€ unless I really want it
maybe 200-300€/$ would be what I would pay, if shutter count isnt really high.

I have AD(H)D and I'm very sensitive to sound. I really LOVE the noise cancellation of the XM5. I don't know the difference with the XM4, never had it."
2418,I agree the noise cancellation of the XM5's great. I have put them on a few times just to listen to nothing but quiet when I need to get things done! They are a godsend on a plane too!
2419,"I absolutely LOVE my xm4!
One of my best buys in the last years!
​
I have not tested the xm5 but I have heard that they cant be folded as compact as the xm4 and also that other differences are very minor; so for pricing you can very confidently go for the xm4.
One youtube reviewer even said he went back to the xm4 after owning the xm5."
2420,"If you have the money, the XM5s are amazing. Best pair of headphones I've owned without a doubt. 
If you're looking to save a bit of money, and want them to be a little more compact the XM4s."
2421,"I was torn on which to get.  I ended up with the XM5. Part of the reason is I had missed holiday pricing on the XM4 at the time, so I went with the latest. Another big reason was most reviewers seemed to agree that voice calling was a major improvement over the XM4. That made a difference to me since I wanted to try to use them for work and for music listening. There are other minor improvements all around including to ANC, and the ear cups and head band are supposedly more comfortable.  
I don't know how much less of a bulge the XM4's would be in a laptop bag, but I am sure I would appreciate slightly more compact case.  It depends on what you prioritze and how much money you can save. You will enjoy either. I personally would lean to the latest model at a $50 price difference. If you can do better than that price difference, the XM4's become more compelling."

2424,I ordered the xm5 to test them and I don’t know if it was just my unit but the sound was noticeably worse than my xm4’s no matter how I tweaked the equalizer. I had to return them

2426,"The mids were worse, sounded almost distorted, bass was just a little weaker and highs were alright but the combination made the sound a downgrade from xm4"

2429,"I have exactly the same experience, the base is very very weak and noise cancelling is way worse than xm4"
2430,"They have a less warm signature.
Details are still as good as ever.
Imo they sound slightly better, atleast as they seem a bit more responsive to EQ"
2431,I agree with this assessment
2432,XM5 has more details.
2433,"Thank you all for your responses. So far from what I got from all the opinions put together, less warm signature, weaker bass, and mids but more details. Does that mean that lower bass and mids made the highs sound more detailed? 🤔
I’m fine with the current xm4 ANC and sound signature. And from the reviewers for XM5 seems the phone call sound quality has largely improved but ANC however has mixed reviews. 
So that means that the better upgrade over the XM4 was just phone calling quality and comfort fit?"

2440,"Ohhhh, makes sense! Thanks!!"
2441,"The reason is simple, regulations on newer models restrict volume levels for safety reasons. For example if you listen to XM5 in some countries they'll be louder. This is probably for the best and with the noise cancelling you wouldn't need it as loud anyway."

2451,"If I'm not mistaken, the stock sizes are SS(i.e. extra small/S/M/L. So the ""XL"" you're looking for that came with the earbuds is probably actually called L. 
Sony tips have color-coded cores, and a light blue core is officially called L. Sony used to make even bigger tips but not in the last few years, and they have a different core color."
2452,"Thanks for the response! The reason I asked was because I got third-party tips and the L pair was noticeably smaller than what I was using, but maybe that's an issue specific to those tips. I'll try another set and see if I have more luck."

2454,"Hi everyone,
I am an happy user of the Sony Wh1000xm3 since 2018. In early 2022 I gave it a second youth with a new battery and ear pads. Unfortunately I tried 3 different third party earpads and no one can match Sony's. Sound is still great but ANC is pretty much ineffective due to hard foams and inexistant shape memory. I am so considering upgrading top to XM4 or 5.
So I would like your advices to choose between those, and why ?
Thank you !"

2456,If you find the xm4 for about half of the xm5 then go that way. The primary improvement ive experienced with the 5's over the 4's is vocal noise suppression. So if thats really important go that way.
2457,"The noise cancellation in the XM5 is actually better but for me the biggest reason to go for the XM5 over the 4 is the comfort. The design of the 4 did not sit in my ear right and pressed up on some cartilage in my ear so after several hours they became so uncomfortable I couldn't wear them anymore. The 5s are super comfortable and I can hardly tell they are in my ear. 
I do think the ambient sound mode in the XM4s was better though. I haven't quite figured out what it is yet but the XM5s just don't seem right to me where as the 4s I couldn't tell I had them in. I'd have one in when I play Mario kart and only wear 1 for Mario kart and there was no difference between the inserted ear and natural.
But with how uncomfortable the XM4s are I say go with the 5s all day long."
2458,Look at Comply for the best foam tips.

2460,"Hello,
I'm askig for help here because I couldn't find anything about a problem similar to mine.
I am on windows 11 on a LG gram laptop, and if I change the volume with the sliding bar, the key (F11/F12) or even in the headphone properties it doesn't change the volume at all. The only way i found to change the volume is thourght the touch pad on the headphone themself and when I do it doesn't show the bar on the screen that would indicate the volume. Wierdly if I mute it or put the volume at 0, it mute it. If I use the free hand version with the microphone activated I can change the volume like normal. I've tried everything i've seen/can think of, forgetting it, audio enhancement off and on, exclusive mode off and on ect... 
Does anyone has a fix ?"

2469,"Hi everyone!
I just bought the WF-1000XM4 buds yesterday. I tested them on my sofa, when my girlfriend immediately looked at me, telling me that she can very clearly hear what I am listening to, and that it would definitely annoy her if she'd be next to me on a train or at work. I also attached a video here, where you can get an impression of the sound leakage.
Also, this happens from around 40% volume upwards. And I never had this with my (considerably less pricey) Soundcore Life P3.
I also googled this, and it does not seem to be a general issue with the buds. At least, I did not find massive discussions about it. Do I have a faulty pair? Or is this a known issue after all?
Any help is appreciated!
Thanks and Best,
Johannes
Sound leakage of my buds (also, a slightly concerned face :-))"

2471,"I have next to no sound leakage when my buds are on, and I always listen higher than 40%. I'm guessing this is either a seal issue or a faulty pair. Did you do the in-app seal test to see how the seal is in your ear? Are you using the default tips that came with the buds? I found them to not provide a good seal at all and got foam ones so that could be part of it"
2472,Never had sound leakage…..I do however have a volume issue that seems unfixable….volume extremely low on ios even though at max
2473,Yeah thats a lot more sound leakage than I would expect. It almost sounds like they are not in your ears. I would check the fit.

2475,"Hiii
I was preparing for a trip on Monday and I “charged” my headphones, but apparently they didn’t charged at all.
Right now at the train I tried once again and I haven’t had any luck, they got stuck in 40% yesterday and today they are at 20%.
They turn on the red light of charging but they don’t charge at all.
If you have any solution and suggestion, I would really appreciate it since it’s been less that a year that I bought them :((((
Edit 2 min later: I just checked and it went up to 30% wtf help hahaha, I’m glad I have more “time” but wth is going onnnnn"

2477,"Your headphones might be going under the ""phase"" of getting ruined by the  software(but hey! It might not too). Check the charge of the case because it might be out of power too. Try resetting the pair if it persists and also look out for any heating problems. The buds and the case shouldn't be too warm while charging because that's obviously a bad sign.
Just go to Sony Care centre if it doesn't go away because you got yourself  some battery issues just like I did. They will cover it under warranty as you said it has been less than a year since you've bought them."
2478,"How do I reset them? Hahah, sorry for the dumb question"

2480,"Are you using wireless charging? I've found that many wireless chargers initially look like theyre charging my case so I walk away, only to come back 2 hours later and find out they only charged for about 30 seconds and then stopped for some reason.

2481,"I’m using wired, I hope I can get them replaced since im living in Germany and I don’t know if the one year warranty is for the whole world ahhh"
2482,"This sounds like a manufacturing issue though, I'm sure Sony will honor the warranty especially since it's been a relatively short period of time"
2483,"Hi, also German here. I’m pretty sure that by EU-Law you have a 2 year warranty on everything. Be it electronic devices or clothing, as long as it’s a production fault and wasn’t caused by yourself.
But as u/JimmyNamess already said. Just contact customer support first."

2497,"I'm wanting to buy the mx4s now the price has dropped due to the release of the mx5s, however I have read up on the drastic battery draining issues a firmware update caused. 
If you have a pair without this update, they're supposed to be among the best buds in the world. However, the last thing I want is to drop £150 on a new pair only to find the battery drains within an hour. 
Does anyone know of a way to ""safely"" purchase the mx4s? Owned/ Pre-owned is obviously a no-go, but I'm concerned even a new model (off Amazon for example) may have this broken update installed. 
Apparently, even if the buds have the newest firmware installed (the patch that fixed the issue) the damage is permanent if the buds have EVER has this patch previously.

2529,"So been testing the Wf1000xm5 out for the past couple of days(Pre-ordered mine at best buy). I noticed two concerning things. One, random cut-outs for no reason at all( doesn't happen a lot but I've had it happen about 5 x in the last 3 days). 2nd sound quality isn't the same always. There are times when I put them on and they sound like only half of the driver is playing resulting in a narrow and hollow sound and then I put them back into the case and take them out again ...then all works and sounds full again. I use an iPhone 14 Pro for my source and don't know if this is tied into it or something else. 
Noted conclusions : 

I really wish they had shipped with silicon tips because the foam tips they have are not really that easy to keep in my ears and I'm always twisting them trying to establish seals. 
The phone call quality is horrible, not better than the Linkbud S and any other Bluetooth earphone.
And finally, the ANC is not the best on the market, Bose is still better in my comparisons."

2531,"valid points. 
concerning the anc, while not perfect like any review or comparison, this video does show a good comparison between the earbuds and the new model does seem to be best.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPkxuSnXmb8
maybe try other tips, I can't use the foam tips with my wf-1000xm4, instead opting for sony's silicone-foam hybrid tips I got with my XBAs."
2532,Thanks for sharing!
2533,thanks...yeah..saw that video too but graphs and measurements don't prove what I hear in real-world environments (it's under a controlled source). Just simply playing my favorite music at 50% volume through my desk speakers and turning on noise canceling without music gives me more suppression of that song with Bose on than with Sony.  And I'm not the only one that have come to the conclusion on various sites and youtube videos...finding that in real-world listening ...they find the Bose better.
2534,then return the WF-1000XM5. simple.
2535,"No graphs are found in my videos and I used them out in real-world environments :)
My peers are great at that, but I post sound samples for a different approach. Both have their benefits and issues."
2536,Encourage everyone to take a stand and contacts Headphones.com and every other sponsor to this guy's channel threatening boycott to send a very clear message that we won't tolerate /u/thisisTechToday 's bullshit
2537,"You are aware of how bluetooth works right? There are two general modes, one for sound quality, one for microphone. What you are describing here sounds a lot like you are misusing your headphones."
2538,Anyone having like a rattle in the earbuds when jogging or shaking your head like somethings loose or is mine bad.
2539,"Yes, sounds like the internals are floating around inside"
2540,"From what I can see the FCC internal photos and the videos from Sony, things look like they are rather tight inside and shouldn't move around."
2541,Yea it only happens when you have anc or ambient on. Turn it off and doesn't happen anymore. It's very annoying
2542,"I got my Wf1000xm5 last Thursday. You are not the only one that experienced glitches while using these buds. They're annoying AF, and im using the Samsung S23+.
I guess we just gotta wait for the next software update for Sony to fix these problems.
I've also had problems with their 'foam tips' that came with it (Surprisingly those tips works much better with my Wf1000xm4, which i still use when i cycle to work. Not ready to sweat through or risk dropping the latest earbuds)
However, i kept my silicon tips from my WF1000xm3. They work well with the wf1000xm5."

2563,"im sure the other guy’s eq is great but its always good to get as many EQ’s as you can and compare them and see which one you personally like the best, so ill attatch mine, I have xm5’s and ive had them for about a year now and im always finetuning my eq and its best to find the one you like the most, then play with the sliders and see if you like the settings changed a little bit here and there. Other than eq, theres nothing else that i really do, i always put it in a case if its going in a suitcase or bag, and i guess just generally dont be rough with them, but im sure you know that already considering the bill you got from sony lmao, also one other thing is the 4’s ive heard tend to be a little more muddy then the 5’s so maybe try bumping the high registers up a few times to get more clarity and crispness in your sound. have fun!

2582,I got Sony WH1000-XM4 that seem to make this static hollow sound only during Noise Cancelling and it feels like only on the right earphone.

2585,"So, i plan on getting the a6700 within the next couple of months so i need to get some lenses along with it. At first, i planned on getting the Tamron 17-70mm f2.8 but since i travel a lot, the lighter Sigma 17-50mm f2.8 seems more convenient. I exclusively take photos but do plan on doing some light videography after getting the new camera. The thing is where i live, the Tamron costs 200$ more than the Sigma so i figured i might as well get a DJI Ronin SC along with the cheaper Sigma since it doesn’t have Optical Stabilisation. Therefore, i shouldn’t have any trouble shooting videos.
So, my question is, will the lack of optical stabilisation hurt during night photography cause i plan on doing a lot of that (and obviously i won’t have the gimbal on during taking photos)."

I have problem with Dolby Atmos between my TV Sony XR-65X93J and Sony AN1000 receiver, connected via HDMI 2.1 8K Ugreen.
I tried to play Atmos from Bravia Core, but it is playing DTS 5.1. I tried 4K remux via Kodi 19.1 - I cannot see the output signal, it only displays TV. How to check what is the output format? I’ve tried the internal media player of the TV and it outputs DTS 5.1 and not Atmos
On the other hand it plays Atmos perfectly from my Sony 4K player.
The TV is set on Auto 2 output for multi channel audio.
any suggestions?"

2619,"Hi! Warranty'd that thing and got a replacement.
It's truly frustrating just how common it is to encounter issues with these incredibly expensive headsets...
Hope you can get a replacement, or sort it out somehow! Lmk how it goes"
2620,Ok. The unfortunate thing is I literally use these headsets for a disability. I have to sleep with them. Guess I’ll be using my old xm3’s. They work but they’re old so they don’t noise cancel as much.

I just bought a KD50X85K online, but didn't bother checking if my PS4 controller would be able to connect to it before purchasing it. Sony's website says it might not, but I can't find a solid answer, and I was hoping someone here with the same model TV could confirm that it either does or doesn't work with a PS4 controller."

I got really excited when I first got the new WF1000XM5 earbuds and used them for a while. However, I noticed an issue while using them for calls on Teams. Whenever someone speaks, I hear a constant buzzing sound in my right ear, which is quite uncomfortable. Has anyone else experienced the same problem?"

2628,"Hello,
Two years ago I bought a a Sony Xperia 5 II from Best buy brand new. I love the phone so much; it's the best phone I've ever had. However, I have been noticing some malfunctioning recently. Sometimes (rarely), it randomly shuts down, and the only way to turn it on it's to do a hard restart (power button+volume up). Additional, the finger print sensor randomly stops working, and the only way to make it work again is by doing a normal restart. I have been taking care of the phone like a newborn baby, so I know I haven't damaged the device. Other than that, the phone is fantastic and works great. Is anybody else having the problem? Should I got a head and submit a claim my Geek Squad protection plan?"

2633,"Probably to clear out X95K stock through X93. Also the higher end Sony TVs simply may not be selling, so having X93 and X95 in all sizes this year would create more stock, expense and Sony competing against itself. LG and Samsung are spending more for marketing and retailer floor space than Sony can afford to compete on (Best Buy is dominated with Samsung TVs), so Sony is probably trying to spend and target what they produce and release."
2634,But X95K 75 and 65 inches were also not released in those countries.
2635,"Which countries? I was talking about the North American market. For other markets maybe production and supply chain related along with sales reasons.
Sony no longer targets the cheap market or competes directly against LG and Samsung. Sony now has a specific higher end niche and very high end, so their sales numbers and target demographics are limited and don’t necessarily sell enough to warrant many size and model options."
2636,"Which countries?

Also my first question looking at the title..."
2637,I am aware that in India only 85 inch is available. It’s one of the largest markets in the world.

2643,Hello everyone I have a Sony x90cj from Costco. After a year I decided to purchase a jbl sound bar. The sound bar is a ARC JBL deep bass  2.1 system. The tv EARC hdmi port is not compatible with this sound system. It recognized it for a brief second and looses the system. If it does stay connected there is no sound. The system works well with optical sound. I replaced the sound system still no go. My ps5 works well on that port. I went through troubleshooting with Sony since tv is under warranty and after troubleshooting they decided to replace the main board under warranty. Upon further investigation a lot of people on this forums also have the same issue…. It seems to be software related on how Sony likes or doesn’t like specific sound systems. Anyone have had a similar situation?

2646,"Hello, so my xm3s just died and I ordered a new pair of xm4s.  
On the xm3s I could raise the volume of the amplification on the headphones independently of the device (my android phone), via the touchpad on the side, meaning I could raise the volume without the source distorting, and the internal amp on the xm3s seemed to do a really good job.  
Now on the xm4s if I raise the volume on the headphones it's locked to the device, and there's no way of separating them as was the case before, so to have music at useable volume it distorts massively.  
My phone doesn't have a ""disable absolute volume"" option (Xiaomi), but it already worked fine with the xm3s.  
Does anybody have any ideas, before I reluctantly have to return the xm4s?"

2649,"Play around in your phone's volume settings. 
When I hit my volume buttons up or down, a volume bar appears on the screen. Directly below it is a menu button, when I click on it allows me to customize the relative volumes for the ringtone, notifications and media. 
Depending on your device, you may have to go into the actual settings."
2650,"Thanks for the reply: I do get that menu, but unfortunately the volumes are still locked together"
2651,"This is pretty funny because the behaviour you prefer is something I complained about a few months ago with my XM4s.
My ""solution"" (as in what caused the issue for me) was updating the headphones software. But if you've already been doing that then I don't know of any settings on either the app side or Android side that can decouple the volumes like you want."
2652,"Yup, I can't see it either: it was definitely possible on the xm3s (whose software I had never bothered updating in 2.5 years), so maybe that's been a victim of poorly updated software."
2653,You sure there is no disable absolute volume slider In your developer settings? It should be there.
2654,"Thanks for the reply: sadly it's not there in MIUI on my Poco phone.
I get the impression that it's on there for certain Xiaomi models, but not mine, annoyingly!"

2656,"Hi,
I am currently looking for new daily headphones since my old pair (MDR-XB950B1) which I had for a couple of years now is dying more and more. I've heard mostly positive things about the WH-1000XM5 but some mentioned that they aren't waterproof. I live in central europe and tbh it feels like 80% of the year it is raining and since I do walk a lot to and from the subway station etc. I was wondering how big of an issue the missing waterproofing actually is.
Does anyone have experience with that or can tell me how reliable they are in bad weather?   
Thank you in advance"

2661,"Not sure how to describe it, but when connected to my laptop the audio from my WF-XM5's sounds very...echoey. It sort of sounds like I'm in a very echoey room (like an empty room with no carpet or furniture when you move into a new house) with a speaker playing music. It's most noticeable with non-music audio, like podcasts and youtube videos. Don't have this at all on my phone though.
Solution: On windows 11 sound settings select the earbuds, and set ""Audio enhancements"" to ""off"". I could swear this was one of the first things I tried but oh well, at least it got solved eventually"

You want Stereo, Handsfree is a lower bandwidth channel to be able to enable the use of the microphone channel of the headphones. Using the microphone is not recommended, that will mute the Stereo channel as well."
2667,"Got it. It's windows 11's stupid ""audio enhancements"". Don't even know what they're supposed to do, but good riddance"
2668,"That was the solution to the same issue on my WH-1000XM4's. However I've tried disabling the ""headset"" version of the XM5s in the device manager and nothing's changed"
2669,"Just to rule it out, assuming you're running Windows, have you tried clicking the volume icon in your taskbar, selecting the device drop-down and selected the Stereo channel?"
2670,"I have, yeah. I had the same issue with my old WH-XM4's and that solved it right away. But for these there's only one option, ""Headphpones (WF-1000XM5)"". No headset option available to switch from/disable
There's a ""WF-1000XM5"" in the ""Input"" section of the sound settings, but removing it removes the earbuds all together"

2682,"I have the WF XM4, and I would like them if they didn't have the battery issues. The hype about Sony's ANC isn't overblown. it really is effective, and they can be EQ'd to sound pretty good. 
That said, I would stick with those Galaxy Buds (especially considering they are free). They might actually work well for you if they fit well. 
AKG does the sound tuning for the Galaxy Buds, so they probably sound nicer than the Sony (personally, I haven't tried either the XM5 or Buds Pro's), but I know my Galaxy Buds Live sound excellent for most music.
I'm willing to bet the XM5 is excellent, I'm just skeptical due to the issues with my XM4. If you do get the XM5, you will have two of the best earbuds out there."
2683,"True I guess, just needed some confirmation. I'll stick to the buds 2 pro. Thank you :)"
2684,"Stay with the free ones, buy the xm5s when they go on sale for $100 off in a year or two"
2685,u think they're gonna have a black friday sale for these buds?
2686,They'll have to be over a year old before they get a sale I imagine. That's just a speculation
2687,"I have the buds pro 2 and my xm5s came in today. I'll play around with both for a few days but immediately id say go with the buds pro 2 unless you need the best anc. It is noticeably better. It's kinda nuts honestly. And the sound quality is better too but the buds sound great as well. Size/comfort still goes to the buds but it's close. You can't beat free and you're getting like 80-90% of the product. Honestly there's a decent chance I'll return these and stick with the buds. 
I will say I did have some connection drop issues on the xm5s. Happened maybe 5-10 times today. And some weird issues where it would switch to anc or ambient or off randomly. Did install a new update today so hopefully it fixes it."
2688,"Yea I'm going to stick with the Buds Pro 2 for now, as long as they sound better than the normal pros I'll be happy for now. I never had a single connection issue in the last few years with the buds"
2689,"In no way, the ANC and sound quality are equally as good if not better. Cronical (https://youtu.be/45AHeEquI-s) ranked them the best sounding TWB just 10 months ago. Only if you regularly use your buds for more than 5h with ANC or 8h without would it be reasonable to buy the XM-5s."
2690,Xm5 for sure...
2691,"The XM5 will mop the floor with the buds 2 pro. The xm5 have the best crisp sound quality and seperation of instruments i have ever heard.
I tried all of them xm5, xm4, mtw3, freebyrd, buds 2 pro.
But I personally like the xm4 over the xm5 because they produce deeper bass and the music is punchy. The xm5 has a wider sound  stage and hd audio but lack the dynamic. Meaning everything sounds overprocessed and has no life in the playback. It sounds flat but clean. The XM4 focus more on voice and emphasis the instruments better which I like. The XM5 on the other hand focus on the bass and drums, it mutes the singer into the background which i didnt like. Guess its a matter of taste."
2692,"I've had xm3, xm4s, buds 2 and currently use  buds pro 2 and over ear wh-xm4. 
Buds Pro 2 win on all fronts: Smallest and best fitting, great sound (better and more natural than sony) battery life and honestly very good ANC. I was disappointed with xm4s ANC to a point thst I returned first pair. 
Buds and buds pro are the first headphones that don't fall out of my ears when training."
2693,"Sound good, I'll stick to the Buds Pro 2 then. Thanks for your help :)"
2694,Enjoy your buds 2 pros....
2695,"Ok so let me tell you my conclusion after watching all the reviews for you (yeah I know I don't have a life I was bored 😅) so they say that out of all the rest of the buds the 2 pro are the closest the xm5 in sound detail and quality but they lack in the base department (as an audiophile and the brother of someone who owns the buds 2 pro and as a proud owner of the xm4 they are right if you tune it correctly it sounds awesome) the battery life is the exact same the anc on the xm5 is around 35% more effective with the high frequency sounds 
So if I were you I would stick with the buds 2 pro for now 
And I pre order a pair of the xm5 so I will tell you how that goes😂"

2697,"Forgot about this comment and just opened reddit for the first time after I commented, so, I got the xm5 , and they are as good as I described. But I was blown away by the anc bc it can single handedly cancel out the sound of a jet while playing Minecraft music on like 10% volume, the new options are great. If you would like to know anything else just ask me 😅"
2698,"But ""lacking"" bass is a good thing here. It's tuned to the Harman Curve (Harman just like AKG is owned by Samsung) which is statistically pleasing for the greatest amount of users. The bass on the Sonys has always been overblown, but as always there are people who prefer up to 15 dB gain on the low frequency range compared to the 10 dB of the Harman Curve."

That was 2 years ago if M5 have not improve this part to the level off Jabra elite this it's a F joke 4 years of what improvement???

2724,Honestly yes u can they are indeed small enough to do so tho it really depends on your pillow I use big fluffy yet firm memory foam pillows I can say I can comfortably wear them while laying on a pillow for a few hours for me its like 4 to 5 hours ( it will cause fatigue tho ) but yes u can
2725,"Yes I do. And it's much more comfortable. Wife snores, so need noise cancelling."

I got this one first because it had a faster due date arrival and still waiting on tpu coming between August 15th-25th. Overall, the look of the vegan leather and carbon fiber pattern is luxurious."

2732,Just received mine… I agree with the comments here below from Year_Haunting… for me it’s ok while waiting for Spigen one…
2733,Same here. I asked but they said no ETA. 🤦🏽‍♂️

Want to buy Sony camera, right now I'm torn between A6700 and A7 mark 4, I'm leaning toward A6700 because of the smaller body and newer soft/AI features. However if A7C mark 2 will have all the A6700 features with a FF sensor it would be a better choice than A7iv.
Also wondering if the A7Cii will have a crop in 4k60 as A7iv, they are using the same sensor so probably yes."

I am into landscape photography, so I want the full frame to squeeze even wider shots and something that is lightweight.  
I would just go for a7c if there wasn't an upgrade around the corner."

2775,"Hi I wondered if anyone else is experiencing this, cause if they are this is absolutely unacceptible either on sony's or microsoft's end. I've known before today that windows bluetooth technology is pretty damn bad and unrealiable, but when I try to connect my WH-CH520, windows actually breaks the headphones. 
It says I'm connected for a short while, after that the connection is lost. But what is just baffling is that the headphones don't turn on after trying this. I was afraid i broke them permanently but after putting them on a charger I got them to work again.
But now I'm too scared to try and connect them to my laptop again out of fear they'll break (which again, is just outrageous).
Has anyone else gotten these headphones to work with windows bluetooth?"

2783,A90j is the 2021 model year so yeah discontinued.  Look for k sales (2022) for the same value or L (2023)
2784,"You can still find them online, I bought an 83"" A90J about 9 months ago off eBay for a killer price.  Just be aware a lot of the big box stores no longer carry it and the folks selling them might not be authorized sellers which can impact the warranty.  Best TV I have ever seen!"
2785,65 inch and 83 inch are still available at bestbuy

2797,"So I’m thinking about getting the STR-AN1000 but had a couple of questions..
1: Can the receiver do dual subwoofer through one wired and one wireless? 
I have the A7000 soundbar and the SA-SW3 subwoofer. I would wanna possibly use the Sony subwoofer, but also have a wired Yamaha subwoofer from a previous HT system. For dual wireless I know you must use two of the same Sony’s.
2: Can you sneak your way into 4 Atmos channels if you use the Sony SA-RS5 wireless surrounds? 
I’d probably go the Atmos route but was curious what options I’d have. I could obviously do 5.1.2 with traditional speakers or might I be able to 5.1.4 (or maybe even 7.1.2?) with the SA-RS5 surrounds? Use the built in amplification for two Atmos channels then the SA-RS5 for the other two Atmos channels?
TIA!! 🤓🤙🏻"

2804,"Have had the XM4 no issues so far, but mine are not that old."
2805,Fair enough.
2806,"Problem is that those issues only started after a while, with one particular firmware making things much worse. So only time will tell, I assume the battery of every XM5 will be good right now.
Having said that, my XM4s which are about 1.5 years old and were only used occasionally are losing charge rather quickly and unevenly, eventually the right bud will have over 10% less battery than the rest. So what others are seeing too, I'll try to get them exchanged next week, was just waiting for the XM5s.
And I haven't noticed this behaviour with my new 5s yet, the percentages go down way slower and on the left and right evenly. But again, very early days, I really hope Sony has learned. Since we got a two year warranty by law here in Germany the risk is limited for me, it's still a gamble though."
2807,"Hmm, good to know. I'm happy that you have a 2 year warranty at least."

Noise cancelling the XM5s are for sure better not just in their ability, but they do a better job at not leaving you feeling plugged up.  Now vs the WH's...great question I will have to fire those up and see.  
but vs the XM4's, which at the time they came out they were my favorite buds for sound and ANC.  These are a worthwhile upgrade in both categories.  not to mention more comfortable. they aren't Air Pods Pro 2 comfortable, but I would rank them either 2nd or third when compared to the APP2, the Galaxy buds pro 2, the bose qc ii and the pixel buds"

2820,"Lol, you used the equalizer ? Or just plug em?"
2821,What kind of equalizer can I use on pc? and if you're talking about the sony one on mobile then yes
2822,APO PEACE?
2823,"You also need to turn the headphones on when plugging them in. The headset needs more power than the audio jack can provide, thus making it sound really cheap when it’s not turned on. But obviously you troubleshooted before complaining right?"
2824,Yeah I already knew that I needed to turn them on :D I did that much at least..
2825,"And they’re still low on bass? That’s hard to believe. On your phone, do you plug them in or do you connect with Bluetooth? And if you use Bluetooth, do they still have no bass?"
2826,"I use Bluetooth yeah.. I think the wired is only good for pc.. And well I've tweaked the eq a lot tried a few different ones from other users and it's okay now.. But well the bass level if I had to compare to my old headset is like 50% of my hs70. I understand that the sony are like very high end and have to have ""natural sound"" but it's just a bit underwhelming for me with the bass since I'm a basshead..
I guess it's purely just taste? For some the bass may be enough or I've even seen it was too much.. For me it's too little sadly"
2827,"On the phone I have the clear bass option on 8, and on pc the bass is indeed noticeable less but that can be compensated with an EQ on pc. But Sony isn’t really natural sound focused, the headphones are rather bass heavy compared to regular headphones. So it could still be that you have a faulty unit, what also could be is that you may use a audio jack cable extender, I used that too on the headphone and when I used a single cable with 3 black stripes on the jack the bass also significantly improved."
2828,I mean maybe there is a chance of a faulty one? But how likely could that be truly.. And for the audio jack cable I've just tried it with the provided one of sony in the box
2829,"Then idk what could be the issue, maybe you’re used to hearing a lot of bass. On rtings.com I see that the HS70 Bluetooth is more heavy on high bass spectrum and the Sony heavier on the low bass. Or maybe you could have a faulty unit. But I doubt that since the headphones are working."
2830,"Yeah exactly I guess it's just not my ""cup of tea"" sadly I'm probably gonna be returning them fully or well selling them."
2831,The new headphone’s app allows you to configure the eq much easier with a wizard like setup. If you don’t have the eq on and no noise canceling active they sound like crap.
2832,"Turiu XM5 pusę metų ir nulis problemų.
Vps 0 bass -> Headphones connect app -> Clear bass iki +5 (mano EQ) ir problemos kaip nebūta. Susižiūrėt reikia visus settingus ir įsijungt LDAC.
Ant kompo make sure kad yra išjungtas mikrafonas. Nes windowsai tiesiog nesugeba abiejų kanalų palaikyt. ARBA turi AAC ir normalų garsą ARBA SDAC ir garsą + mikrafą.
Taip, ausinės nėra best straight out of the box, bet praleidus valandą su EQ ir settings, nuostabios ausinės. Tik reik suprast kam jos skirtos (enterntaiment ne games)."
2833,"Sveikas, dėkui už pagalbą bet deja aš jau net ant +10 užsistates ir man vis dar negana.. Deja nemanau kad joks eq nepatenkins manęs pilnai :("
2834,"ANC off NC on? Dėl skonio nesiginčijama žinai, bet vadint XM5 visiška šiukšle gal nevertėtų. Yra 14 dienų garantinis, nepatiko - grąžink."
2835,Bandžiau abudu be noise canceling geriau truputi
2836,"OK. Ką aš žinau, ne visiem normalūs draiveriai ( ne gaming) patinka (kas patinka man gal tau nepatiks). Also lygint Gaming ausines ir XM5 nėra labai fair, įranga sukurta skirtingiems tikslams. 
As I said nepatiko - grazink per 14."

2840,"For context I had the XM4s until I left them in a bag which got left on public transport (registered it with TFL 3 weeks ago and haven't heard back). 
I just bought the XM5s on Amazon and they arrived today. Had so many issues with the tips (even 3rd party tips) for the XM4s that I had to get custom printed 3D tips for them (the company have a scan of my ear). Unfortunately they don't do them for the XM5s yet, and they take like 3 weeks to make and ship etc.
I've been testing the different ear tips with the app for the XM5s and I find I have to shove them deep in my ears (making them uncomfortable and making me feel pressure, which never happened with the custom printed tips). I tested them multiple times with all the different tips. 
I just tested them two or three times with 2 sets of tips (one bud having large and one having small) and I did not touch the earbuds at all during the multiple tests (although at points they felt they were falling out) and one time it said both were airtight, and the other said I needed to adjust the 'headphone wearing condition' or tip size???
Edit: finally just got it to say ear tips air tight for both but my left it goes in fairly easily and feels very comfortable but with the right I have to shove it into my ear until it hurts and then rotate.
Also not sure why it would say both ear tips are airtight when I can wiggle my head and make one earbud fall out??
Not sure what to do. 
Even if I could get custom ear tips (which can't fit in the case etc. I'd have to carry them separately) they take 2-3 weeks to make and I'm going away on Saturday next week. 
How do I just make the ear tips fit and feel comfortable? I don't want to lose them on the plane etc."

2842,"I've never had a successful fit test yet, but I can hear sound just fine, noise cancelling seems to be the same in both buds while in ear and neither have ever come loose or fallen out.
I think it's less about what the test says and more about what's comfortable for you.
Although I'm curious about the 3D printed tips, where did you get those from and how were they?"
2843,"That sounds great for you. The ones the headphine test fit seems to be more 'accurate' for is the small tips, but I've already had the one bud fall out while cycling (on a stationary bike in my home gym). Not sure if I'd trust them for exercise outdoors. 
Managed to get the tips to fit after that, but I can 'feel' them (like feel a pressure) which I never had with the silicon custom tips (but they don't fit in the case annyoingly). And thr right one (the one that fell out) I had to push it in further and then it hurt a bit.
The headphone test thing is supposed to be to get the best sound/ANC (ANC is important to me bc I'm autistic and I can get sensory overload/have meltdowns from too much/too many different types of noises/crowds) 
Maybe I just haven't got the twist bit right. I tried to squish the ear tips down but I have motor skills issues so I can't get them to stay squished- they go back to their original shape before I can get them in my ears. 
I had a feel in my ears and one canal feels bit shallower so It could be impacted earwax/my ears need a clean out. Thay might help.
I got the 3d printed tips from Snugs. They were great. A tiny bit uncomfortable at first but after like a day they were great. After that they only ever hurt/didn't fit if I accidentally put them in the wrong ear (they don't have L or R printed on them, one had my name in white and one with my name in black so I had to work put which was which. I'd forget sometimes)."
2844,Have you thought about trying the over ear headphones? They might be better for your autism.
2845,"I've got a pair of the old over ear XM3s somewhere and they're great for noise cancelling, but not exactly portability.
Also I don't really want people to think I'm being weird' in public with the over ear ones because I'm purposefully ignoring them/being anti social; they're a little too conspicuous for my liking.
They're also not that comfortable for long periods of time. Before I lost my XM4s I travelled to the South of France over a few days with my dog (pet friendly taxi for 8 hours to Paris, then a 6 hour train 2 days later) and they wouldn't have been comfortable for that long."

2850,"Hey everyone!
I recently got a pair of Sony WF-1000XM4s from a friend.
The right earbud seemed to buzz/rattle/vibrate whenever I make a sound on certain frequencies (mostly bass), and the same is true when listening to audio through them.
The issue is far less noticable once I turn off the noise cancellation, buzzing and rattling only on very specific frequencies when listening to music.
Also worth noting, that this right earbud is far quieter than the left one in general.
I took a look inside the right earpiece's hole and saw that the little inner foam pad is jammed quite deep down inside, and I think that may be the cause to it all. Does that make sense?
I've tried to take it out with a couple toothpicks, a needle, and the pair of smallest tweezers I have available (they can get in, but can't really get a grip), but nothing seemed to help.
Any idea on how to take it out of there?
I'm hoping that the stuck foam pad is the cause."

2877,"I’ve had some bad experiences with Samsung and LG TV’s when it comes to motion.
Over the past three years, I have purchased and returned three brand new TVs with high hopes of upgrading my home entertainment experience. The specific models I tried include the LG OLED55C9PLA, the Samsung Neo 50QN92A, and the Samsung QE55Q90T. Although these TVs boasted impressive picture quality, HDR support, and HDMI 2.1 features, I encountered significant motion issues across all of them.
In gaming, I noticed pixel distortions or an extra aura around moving objects, particularly during camera panning, while playing games like Assassins Creed Valhalla and Spider-Man: Miles Morales. Though adjusting judder and stutter settings provided some improvement, it often led to other undesirable effects like blurry backgrounds or screen tearing. Games running at framerates lower than 60fps exhibited more pronounced problems.
Similarly, while watching movies or streaming content, I experienced issues with panning shots and scrolling credits. The images became blurry, and the text was virtually unreadable until the movement stopped. It appears that these newer TVs struggle to handle content with framerates lower than 60fps, which is particularly concerning for me as a cinephile who values movies at their original frame rates.
What advice would you give me?
TLDR: What Sony TV handles allround motion the best?"

2879,"IIRC from RTINGS Samsung and LG usually use the same panels for their higher end tv models and they have issues with localized dimming in gaming mode. Apparently it reduces it from per pixel to zone based for speed which causes the bright aura.  
I'm not sure about sony tvs I am pretty sure sony usually uses their own panels on the higher end models but the mid and low ones come from various sources usually LG."
2880,"OLED and non OLED handle that differently, but the best are A95K/L or non OLED: X95L or X93L."
2881,Why are they the best?
2882,Those are the top line models with the XR processor.
2883,Is there a big difference with the 2022 models?
2884,"Depends on which one and for which feature. X95L for example is a big upgrade with more features over X95K and since the X95K smaller sized panels had issues, hence why I did not mention that model and instead suggested the cheaper version X93L (comparable to 95K). 
For A95K/L mostly the same but L is brighter."

So I’ve had my Sony zv1 for a bit a year or so and I think maybe 3-4 months ago it started acting up. I mainly use it for pottery videos, vlogs and side cams for dancing. It used to be able to record for more than 30min with the right settings on but now it can’t even last 1minute and stops recording with a “receiving data”. I don’t think overheating is the problem or storage or battery. I’ve changed the settings so many times but I have no idea what’s wrong with it. I have a video as an example. 
Pleasee helpppp"

Other issue too. Idk if this should happen to but when I turn off my camera it takes longer to close lens. Also when I stop a recording and record again it takes a while to do so too. Don’t know if that’s normal but it didn’t used to be like that

2901,"Hi there,
this is my first post to this sub.  
I bought an Xperia 1 V with the headphones campaign at Saturn, which means I only got the phone and had to register it with my bill in order to get the free headphones as a pre-order bonus. Additionally there was the cashback campaign within which you get a 150€ cashback if you trade in an old smartphone.
So I registered my phone for the free wh1000 but the e-mail I received says something about getting my cashback booked to my bank account within the next 28 days. Thing is, I only registered for the headphones and did not trade in an old phone (yet).   
Does anyone else have this issue or experiences on this?"

I need a TV that is capable of supporting every console from both of these eras. Someone mentioned that plasma would look great, so should I look for something like that? I probably have a size limit of 32"" (if that's a good idea as I'll be sitting at it on a desk) and a budget of maybe £150-200.

I've recently switched to Android, so I'm wondering if it's possible to say downgrade/upgrade to install a units software that support Android Auto?"

2932,"Hi all, since I've had my XM4's I've always used the 3.5 jack through my PC monitor however I had to use the Bluetooth the other day as I wanted to use the mic as well and wow the difference in sound was unbelievable it was much crisper and better quality etc... however the issue I had with the Bluetooth was there was microstuttering, is the best way I could describe it, which was very annoying. I currently just use a USB Bluetooth dongle, so I am not sure if it is that that is causing the issue. I can't really use my headphone port on the PC itself, as it has background static / audio cutting out constantly (I'm guessing It's something I've done incorrectly when building the PC).
I also checked the game in question and there is no difference to the sound options in there when I use either method.
So my question is how can I get the good quality audio I had from using it via Bluetooth either through my monitor's port or via Bluetooth. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks!
Edit: If it helps, the jack information for the monitor is ""L R HDMI Digital Jack"" and the controller information is ""NVIDIA high definition audio"""
2933,"You need to power them on in wired mode to get the same sound signature as wireless, except that the EQ configured in the app is inactive in wired mode."
2934,"Ah, will i also be able to use the mic at the same time with the wire that comes with it?"
2935,"I would think not, since the Bluetooth is shut off in wired mode. The controls except for ANC and transparency are also unavailable, so you will control volume at the source."

2937,"I recently bought a 55"" A80J and wanted to add a soundbar to use the Acoustic Center Sync.
Keep in mind that my neightbours are not really tollerant and the sound travel easily across walls, also the couch+tv are placed all on a side, so acoustic wise is not the best placement.
Now, while the 3k would perfectly fit under my tv, the 5k is larger and i would need to push my tv back on the table to place it.
The 5k is surely better and here in italy i could buy it for 700€ against the 400€ of the 3k, but the question is...is it really worth the extra money?
I rarely watch movies, so 90% of the time i use the tv is to play on the xbox, and while it does support atmos, the games that does are like...18.
So, considering all that, which onewoukld you suggest to me?"

2939,if you aren't going to be using it for movies just get the 3K. if you're going to use it for movies too then the 5K will feel more immersive.
2940,"Well i watch movies sometimes but never from streaming services, i usually download them 😅 i doubt that crap is atmos.
I was considering to start buying some 4K blue rays tho, but still, 90% of the time at the tv will be gaming.
Would you still suggest the 5k?"
2941,you can't upgrade the sound bar later so you won't regret the nicer sound. it's a pretty nice bar. you'll probably be happy with either but the 5K has a more full sound.
2942,"That's something i was keeping in mind too.
Tbh the two added tweeters are what drag me to the 5k more...they'll help with higher frequencies with all sources.
I just fear the upfiring speakers could actually make the audio worse because my high ceiling (is 3m high actually? )"
2943,that's not a high ceiling. When LTT reviewed the 7K they found it could bounce off a soft drop ceiling 5+ Meters up. so 3M hard ceiling is nothing just make sure to auto-calibrate it.
2944,"Ok thanks for the help! Much appreciated :)
One last question then, my living room is 27,5m², almost a perfect square (+4.5m² of the entrance actually, for a total of 31m²), would you consider that a small, medium or large room?"
2945,probably Small/medium?
2946,Btw don't know about ps5 but XBSX has 4k bluray integrated
2947,"Yeah i know , that's why i was thinking about buying some"
2948,Probably also ps5 has it
2949,Yeah i am 99% sure

2951,"i've recently bought the sony wh ch720n headphones mainly for my pc. At first i wanted to use bluetooth as the main way to connect them to my pc, but after 2 bluetooth recievers bought and returned later i gave up because i had a high latency (0.3-0.4 ms) and  it was noticeable and disturbing, noticeable in movies, songs, games etc. Now i tried using the default jack that they come with but i have no way to use the microphone cause the pc has 2 in/out jack ports and the default jack is only for the out jack port. I've tried using a spliter, but without succes(it does not even recognize my mic), i've got an jack-to-usb adapter, still no succes, but this time at least my mic shows up in the settings.
Has anyone else had this problem or does anyone know another solution so that I can also use the microphone of my headphones?"

2989,"The MCU was built and The Incredible Hulk with Edward Norton was deemed non-canon to the rest of the MCU, but with Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross being the same character and actor. Meaning that the Universe wherein The Incredible Hulk takes place is an alternate from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with Thunderbolt Ross being the same person in both universes. Sony could extend an offer to Disney to use the character rights for Edward Norton's Hulk and have him as the Hulk that exists in the Venom Universe, without it having anything to do with the MCU. And Liv Tyler and Tim Roth could come back as well. 
That would allow us to get and R-rated Venom vs Hulk.

3005,"The Now Thats What I Call Music compilation CD's/Cassettes/Vinyls use to be owned by Universal Music Group, but now it seems their owned by Sony.
If you look at a first pressing of say Now Thats What I Call Music 3, it will say Universal Music Group at the bottom.   But if you have a re-issue of it, it says Sony Music Group instead.  If you have a Now Year Book compilation (which is a new series), that will also say Sony Music Group.  So did SMG buy the rights off UMG ?"

3009,"Hi everybody, how are you?
I live in a very noisy neighborhood and many times during the day or to sleep I use headphones, the models I have are the Wh xm4, linkbuds s and the Ch710n.    
I use them just as earplugs many times, without connecting them to any device.    
Are they sending signal (radiation) anyway?
My concern is that several days of the week I use them all night, and it may not be healthy.    
Thanks to everyone for your replies!"

3019,"I have an ICF-CS10iP radio/speaker which works really well for my uses. When transporting the radio, something happened to the power supply the cable between the radio and the brick its self broke. I bought a new one and took that power supply out of it (Turns out, after opening the compartment where the cord leads to that says ""THIS IS NOT A BATTERY COMPARTMENT,BATTERY COPARTMENT IS BOTTOM SIDE."" there is a small clip with two prongs where the power cord comes out of. So I removed it from the new radio and got the broken side removed from the old one, put it in, and it now works like new. (Did that as I could get the new/used radio much quicker than making a post like this and it will probably be ignored by people anyways) But it occurred to me that if I get a new cord for the  new/used radio, I could have two speakers that would work really damn well. So I am now making this post to look for a replacement power supply/cord. The brick end has the label:
E239177 
U075140D42 <-- Note, it could be a capital O or a 0, I do not know.
And then the rest of the label says to not open due to electric shock and all that stuff. So I am specifically looking for the cable that plugs into the outlet, has the block which probably has a transformer, then leads with a cable into the radio, not like a charging cord and standardized stuff, but if you unscrew the compartment and open the radio, it has where that cable plugs in to. (The end looks like a lego-connector. If required, I will be able to send images of the power-brick and where the cord would plug into inside the radio.

No - you won't be able to do that."

3037,Mines finally gave out on me this year. They won't charge anymore and they would only last like 30 minutes before I got the battery low notification. Time to upgrade OP.
3038,It's been a year and four months since I bought it.  By that time the sound was not heard on one side.
3039,Mine died as well. Got a replacement battery off iFixit and replaced it. It's working just fine now.
3040,Mine is not a battery problem.  Both sound and anc on left side are not working.  So there is no point in changing the battery.

So, will I be able to use these headphones with a cable on a computer with no Bluetooth connection? I've had cheaper headphones before with a TRRS connection, so to connect them to my computer (and use the microphone too), I used this type of adapter (shown in the photo). Do you think the same adapter could work on my computer with the WH-1000XM5?

3054,Its garbage. Won't stop this awful ringing in my ears. Can't downgrade the firmware. Am I perma-screwed???
3055,What ringing are you talking about ?
3056,"the ANC creates noise that equals the outside noise that is my understanding. Ever since this update it has just been off especially in the right ear. At first it seemed fine, then it started to make a buzzing noise when cars drove past outside. Then when I would move my head it would go vrrrrrr. And then it started to make really quite loud noises to correct for outside noises, but were really obvious and wrong. For a while it was so bad in the right ear that I couldn't wear them. It seems to have gotten better but the right ear still has a small ringing a bit like tinnitus. If I turn off the audio but leave the NC on it is really obvious. 
Because it is adaptive I assume that is why it is changing and I hope it will sort itself out. If not I will have to call the factory. Had them almost a year and would be funny to send them back after a software update, if they'd even allow it."
3057,Seems the same to me. Still letting lots of noise in until there is an air conditioner on or something. I don’t know why Sony won’t just let me use my NC the way I want to
3058,"Everything seems to be the same, I cant reliably say for sure. 
The new EQ finder feature though, breathed new life into the XM5s. Really made it easy to find and EQ that got the sound *just right*, its amazing."

3071,"Hi all,
My WH1000XM3 headphones just made a popping noise in my right ear and now the right-side cup is quieter. I can only imagine one the the drivers or speakers has failed or partially failed, but this is far from my area of expertise.
I've confirmed that the right cup is indeed quieter by both flipping the headphones and doing a blind test with my partner. Something's gone wrong. 
Before I bust out the solder kit and start exploring, does anyone have any advice for troubleshooting / repairing this at home? Or is it time for a new pair of headphones."

3093,"Today I replaced the battery of my left earbud since I was affected by the draining issue as well.
The replacement were super easy, with a little scratches around the seam but only barley visible.
iFixIt kit is Handy for it due to small cables.
Holding up great so far, even 3% higher compared to the unmodified right bud. 
I will update this post if you are interested and something changes. 
Current firmware: 2.0.1
Replacement video tutorial: https://youtu.be/x2twbzhtLaE
Replacement battery: some from eBay (the one with shortest delivery time), just searched for Z55H
Update:
The left bud works perfectly. 
I now also replaced the right battery, since I discovered it has way less capacity left in it compared to the new left bud. 
~60% in the left one when the right ran out of charge.
The replacement worked fine, but I was a little too confident and glued it together before testing and had to scratch the right bud massively. 
Well, if you try it yourselves, be careful in every step and think before you do something"

3096,"Recently purchased the sonyxm4s second hand off of ebay. 
Nothing seems to be out of the ordinary except for the fact that I feel as though the bolumes too low?
I'm able to listen to music with max volume on without a problem, which I feel shouldn't be the case.
Compared to the $40 earbuds i had prior, i feel they're able to produce volume levels higher than these sonys. 
I read through this subreddit that they should be defening at full volume, but that dosen't seem to be the case for me.
Everything else works fine, so I don't think I got scammed. 
Any ideas?"

3098,"Try using the headphones connect app to turn the volume on the headphones themselves, not the phone, all the way up. Not all phones treat Bluetooth volume the same way. I've found I need to do this sometimes depending on the device I'm using."
3099,"Will try this out, thank you!"
3100,"No, dosen't seem to be the case :/"
3101,"Ah Damn, then it could be one of two other things, I'd say. 1. They're broken. Or 2. There's a buildup of earwax inside the earbud ""stem"" that would need to be cleaned out somehow in order to get proper sound out of them."
3102,Omg 😭😭😭 ok thanks man!
3103,Do you have a iPhone?
3104,"No, i have a galaxy s10"
3105,Damn I don’t got a potential fix then. But if you have a audio setting for headphone safety or reducing loud sounds that can be your culprit. Hope that helps in some way but I don’t know what settings are on your OS.
3106,"Not sure if this helps, if your phone have an
Equaliser setup, and you tune the equaliser of the Sony app as well, it will affect it, try switching 1 of the equaliser off and see"
3107,"Will check this out, thanks!"
3108,"Yes, you are deaf or there is something wrong
99% of headphones at 100% will cause hearing damage
Xm4 and other Sonys are so loud at 100% that normal person just cant weae them because it hurts
Mine are way too loud a 50% and 100% is super loud which i would never use.
20-30% is loud enough"
3109,"I gave it to my friend afterwards and he also thinks its ""loud, but not loud enough"""
3110,U wl not get high quality sound without amplifier even if u have best of earphones. Try to get dragonfly or fiio usb c amplifier
3111,"Will try this out, thanks!"
3112,"Are you using them with the Bluetooth connection? I also have sony headphones and I find they are really quiet when connected with a wire to my phone or playstation, but when using bluetooth the volume is a lot higher."

3123,"I tested those longterm, vs my Beats Studio Buds. I was not satisfied with Beats, because of Battery life. But what i experienced with those, is even worse. I researched a lot on YouTube, and i can tell you, they all talk bullshid. They are lowder, they sound clearer, they are better in building quality. All bullshit. They last longer without any ANC, it’s true. But you can’t clean them, like other In-Ears. Also, you will find no other Bass like the Beats deliver. Those YouTube suggestions are bullshid.

Sure, sony puts a ton of bass into the wh1000xm4 and other products in the Extra Bass series, making it kinda boomy. However, the wf1000xm4 is in another league, one of my favourite bass of all time, good layering, punchy and energetic."
3126,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWdd6_ZxX8c I love mine. I wouldn't want more bass than they have. It blends well.

3132,"It has been over 3 years now. Over 4000+ hours of streaming. fell over 4 times. but lemme get this to you straight:
Abso-flippin-lutely a MONSTER
pros:
- gargantuan battery life
- no internal defects
- non-deteorating sound quality
- lightweight
- touch controls(once you get used to it; kinda a wierd flex among peers ngl)
- fall-resistant
- easy to clean
-smart(auto connects to last connected device fast AF)
cons:
-calls( i kinda prefer not to use my sony for that)
-touch controls(auto registers sometimes)
-decreased battery life(well its expected; still gives 20 hours of audio playback with ANC)
- totally unusable in hot and humid regions( I live near coastline; it smells lol)(also internal screws catches a mild case of rusting)
-nothing else really. A total beast.
PS:
if you hold power button for 7 secs it disconnects from currently connected device and goes into pairing mode(really helpfiul).
And yes, if it costs you less than 150ish US dollars present day, totally worth it.

3134,OEM pads are no longer made unfortunately. My third party pads started flaking in under a month. I miss my XM3's. I got XM5's and I hate them
3135,"Yeah, that kinda sucks. Third party pads are hella stiffer(speaking from experience)"
3136,"I considering to upgrade my WH XM3 to XM5, curious about what is the bad things about it?"
3137,"The noise canceling uses an AI auto-optimizer which is really finicky and only engages noise canceling at certain times. When they work in full NC they are great, but that is maybe 20% of the time. There is no way to reconfigure them. Super frustrating."
3138,"omg, no firmware updates to address that?"
3139,"They came out with a new one just today I think, but I haven't tested it yet. The last one didn't seem to help at all"
3140,Pls keep us posted. Didn't know the XM5s couldn't be manually set to full NC indefinitely.
3141,"I think the build was pretty sub par, I’ve owned them for 4 years and jumping to the XM5s was like going from a Toyota to a space ship. Loved mine but they’ve aged pretty ok in general"
3142,"As MKBHD once said, two steps forward, one step back.
(Overall I kinda adore XM5, except that it can't fold)"
3143,"Really bad for people that suffer with excessive earwax. Had to strip out the sponge as it became so blocked no sound could be heard. Have to clean regularly to stop wax getting past the aperture and damaging the speaker.
Microphones are also unreliable on mine - one has heavy feedback so I have to turn off ANC manually each time. Can't seem to set OFF as default.
The other one seems to have a problem with equalising pressure, so I regularly have to reinsert it ... Again probably blocked with wax somewhere.
Maybe I should switch to headphones."

Maybe I should switch to headphones."

3147,"I struggle with my motor skills. I struggled so much (partially bc my ears are weird too. Even with 2 different sized tips I struggled to get a good seal etc) when I had the Sony WF-1000XM4s (apparently WhatHiFi spoke to Sony, the XM4s will be discontinued) - even with different sized tips bought on Amazon - that eventually I got Snugs custom ear tips (they scan your ears  and 3d print them) 
I lost my Sonys a few weeks ago (left them in a bag which got left in the back of a London taxi; reported it to TFL but haven't heard back yet) and I decided to wait it out and purchase the XM5s instead, which say they'll arrive between the 26th and 27th July.
My issue is I'm going on holiday on the 4th of August for 2 weeks, and the Snugs tips are custom made and take 2 weeks to make, and right now they don't do ones for the XM5s (I guess bc they've just been released). 
Even if I replace the XM4s instead of opting for the XM5s  (don't really see the point though, bc I've been wanting to upgrade for a while, and the XM4s will eventually be discontinued) I still have to wait 2 weeks for the Snugs to be made. 
My mum does have a pair of wireless over the ear Beats (which still use micro USB to charge, which tbh makes no sense as its so old fashioned compared to USB C) which she doesn't mind me borrowing occasionally when I've been in the home gym these last few weeks, but I can pretty much guarantee we'll both want to watch/listen to stuff on the plane. Also I prefer having ny own headphones. 
Is there a way to guarantee getting at least a somewhat good seal with the provided tips until I can get Snugs made for the XM5s?"

3160,"Hello! I’m currently in the process of comparing Bose QuietComfort 45 and Sony WH-1000XM4 to decide what headphone to buy. The Sony has way more features, and there is one that they are advertising quite hard that I have some questions about. Adaptive sound control:
“The activity recognition feature—Adaptive Sound Control—automatically detects your physical situation and adjusts to changes. With Adaptive Sound Control, you can hear ambient sounds together with music when walking, announcements while waiting, and be immersed in music with noise cancellation when traveling by train or bus.
This smart listening experience is enabled by the SENSE ENGINE™. Also, preferences can be customized with the Sony | Headphones Connect app.”
My questions are:
1. Is this function built into the headphones, or does it use the connect app? How does it work more exactly?
2. I saw that there were also the ability to geofence noise canceling. iPhone users: I know that apps running in the background can be really off sometimes. Does this function work reliably and does it drain your battery significantly?
3. If you use this function, does it work well?"

3162,"Not an iPhone user, but the noise control stuff works pretty well for me. I turned off the walking/sitting detection since I prefer to have them in one mode usually, but for the time I did have it on, it worked pretty well. I usually use the geofenced auto-switching, which works pretty well. I believe both sorts of autoswitching use the app."
3163,"Ah, okay. It’s the iPhone part that I’m mainly worried about. I have a Fitbit smartwatch and my experience is that iPhone apps doesn’t run in the background that smoothly. Not a problem with the Fitbit since it just has to sync a couple of times per day, but if the headphones require constant connection to the app for those functions to work, I’m a little concerned."
3164,"I'm on Android, but in my experience, the app itself does not need to be opened for the functions to work.  It is good for getting the settings how you want them or adjusting more complicated things manually, but once things are set up I never have to open the app or I don't feel like it.
There is also a widget that shows all the information all the time, so some amount of connection is happening, of course, but that is passive through the same Bluetooth connection you are using to connect to the phone anyway.
Less related, but FYI, the next generation, Wf-1000xm5, is releasing this week. The 4 series is great and should be extra discounted, so both are good choices."
3165,"Yeah, XM4 is just at the top of my prince range and it’s insanely popular so I’ll stick to it. Or go with Bose. Still not sure. That’s why I am trying to understand how app-dependent the special noise cancelling functions are."

3179,"I have WF-1000XM4 and they're great except for the single most important feature: phone calls.
I'm significantly hard of hearing and I rely heavily on noise canceling while on the phone. If there's background noise during my call I CANNOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING. This shitty ""feature"" is ableist as hell and it is beyond infuriating that the consumer is robbed of the right to CHOOSE which features to disable.
There HAS to be a way to hack into the software or something and disable this dreadful ""feature"" permanently so I don't have to return these and buy new ones that actually do what every other noise canceling device I've ever bought before this can do. Their reason for making this mandatory feature is completely asinine. 
I find it hard to believe they can't fix this issue by updating their software. Buying a new pair of earbuds can't be the only answer. These things were programed somehow... There has to be a way to forcibly disable this feature."

3181,¿Has a complaint already been filed that we can all sign or something?
3182,I think we should email sony support en masse about it
3183,There have been already complaint about this in this subreddit so there is probably something someone already did that we can back up.

3185,"I know this is very subjective, but I’ve been wondering what’s better out of the WH XM4’s and 5’s? I know this has been asked before on this sub, but I haven’t found a definite answer yet. (This would be used on iOS devices too, but may even be used for windows possibly - but mostly iOS, so I’m not sure how much LDAC would be used)! Thx!"

3187,"My experience with WH-1000XM4:
I own a pair of WH-1000XM4 and I've been using them for over 3 years now and have been working great. Though I do have some wear and tear with the ear cushions so I had to replace them with wicked cushions https://wickedcushions.com/products/replacement-ear-pads-for-sony-wh1000xm4-black. 
I also had a ANC mic feedback loop that was caused by humidity but after some cleaning with so isopropyl alcohol the issue was resolved. Out of the box the sound is ok but if you want to take full advantage of the pair you can look around for some eq, I personally use the autoeq one with the wavelet eq app(I use android) and searched some on this community. They also support a feature where you can connect to 2 devices though that configuration supports only AAC or SBC. 
Answer to LDAC:
Just to let you know iOS does not support LDAC, and  windows does not support natively. There is a software that claims to support LDAC but I wouldn't recommend installing drivers that could be potentially malicious and that aren't properly supported by Sony. The only way you can have LDAC properly is either buying a dac that support that codec instead of risking with a software that installs drivers that may not work. 
ANC on WH-1000XM4:
The ANC is great and from other posts they say that the XM4 is better at cancelling out deeper sound like engine noises, so better for travelling plus the XM4 has a smaller footprint when you fold it into its carrying case compared to the XM5."
3188,Great! Thanks so much! Would these be ideal for usage on planes and such on long hour journeys? Thanks!
3189,"Yes they are, I just came from a recent trip as soon as I put them on and do a quick ANC optimization the sound vanished, as soon as I remove them I'm taken by surprise to how noisy the plane is once you remove them.
To summit all they are great for that use case."
3190,Got the XM4s and Im loving them. Really happy with the sound and comfort. I can recommend them 100%
3191,XM4's where amazing until they started whistling. It's bullshit that you have to clean them so I'm going to give the XM5's a try in about 2 weeks. I'm currently using the XM2's until then which have been working great for about 5 years now
3192,Xm4. just because you can fold them.
3193,"XM5's are awful. I buy noise-canceling headphones to cancel noise. The auto-optimizer is terrible, and the headphones don't deliver on their core promise."
3194,Keep us posted on whether the software update allows overriding of the AI adaptive NC.
